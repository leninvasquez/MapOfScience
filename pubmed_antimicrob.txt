TI  - The Amazing World of Peptide Engineering: the Example of Antimicrobial Peptides from 
      Frogs and Their Analogues.
PG  - 722-37
AB  - This review discusses the importance and properties of antimicrobial peptides from 
      frogs and their synthetic analogues as potential therapeutic alternatives in 
      fighting not only bacterial infections, but also protozoans involved with the major 
      neglected diseases, which afflict human populations (e.g., Chagas disease, African 
      sleeping sickness, Leishmaniasis and malaria). Here, we emphasize their 
      multifunctional properties such as promising broad-spectrum drugs that target 
      protozoan parasites too.

AB  - More than 3000 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been discovered, seven of which 
      have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Now 
      commercialized, these seven peptides have mostly been utilized for topical 
      medications, though some have been injected into the body to treat severe bacterial 
      infections. To understand the translational potential for AMPs, we analyzed 
      FDA-approved drugs in the FDA drug database. We examined their physicochemical 
      properties, secondary structures, and mechanisms of action, and compared them with 
      the peptides in the AMP database. All FDA-approved AMPs were discovered in 
      Gram-positive soil bacteria, and 98% of known AMPs also come from natural sources 
      (skin secretions of frogs and toxins from different species). However, AMPs can have 
      undesirable properties as drugs, including instability and toxicity. Thus, the 
      design and construction of effective AMPs require an understanding of the mechanisms 
      of known peptides and their effects on the human body. This review provides an 
      overview to guide the development of AMPs that can potentially be used as 
      antimicrobial drugs.

TI  - Development of Amphipathic Antimicrobial Peptide Foldamers Based on Magainin 2 
      Sequence.
PG  - 1911-1916
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.201900460 [doi]
AB  - Magainin 2 (Mag 2), which is isolated from the skin of frogs, is a representative 
      antimicrobial peptide (AMP), exerts its antimicrobial activity via microbial 
      membrane disruption. It has been reported that both the amphipathicity and helical 
      structure of Mag 2 play an important role in its antimicrobial activity. In this 
      study, we revealed that the sequence of 17 amino acid residues in Mag 2 (peptide 7) 
      is required to exert sufficient activity. We also designed a set of Mag 2 
      derivatives, based on enhancement of helicity and/or amphipathicity, by 
      incorporation of α,α-disubstituted amino acid residues into the Mag 2 fragment, and 
      evaluated their preferred secondary structures and their antimicrobial activities 
      against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As a result, peptide 11 
      formed a stable helical structure in solution, and possessed potent antimicrobial 
      activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without significant 
      cytotoxicity.

TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial and anticancer activities of three peptides identified 
      from the skin secretion of Hylarana latouchii.
PG  - 1469-1483
LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmab126 [doi]
AB  - The skins of frogs of the family Ranidae are particularly rich sources of 
      biologically active peptides, among which antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute 
      the major portion. Some of these have attracted the interest of researchers because 
      they possess both antimicrobial and anticancer activities. In this study, with 
      'shotgun' cloning and MS/MS fragmentation, three AMPs, homologues of family 
      brevinin-1 (brevinin-1HL), and temporin (temporin-HLa and temporin-HLb), were 
      discovered from the skin secretion of the broad-folded frog, Hylarana latouchii. 
      They exhibited various degrees of antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against 
      test microorganisms and hemolysis on horse erythrocytes. It was found that they 
      could induce bacteria death through disrupting cell membranes and binding to 
      bacterial DNA. In addition, they also showed different potencies towards human 
      cancer cell lines. The secondary structure and physicochemical properties of each 
      peptide were investigated to preliminarily reveal their structure-activity 
      relationships. Circular dichroism spectrometry showed that they all adopted a 
      canonical α-helical conformation in membrane-mimetic solvents. Notably, the 
      prepropeptide of brevinin-1HL from H. latouchii was highly identical to that of 
      brevinin-1GHd from Hylarana guentheri, indicating a close relationship between these 
      two species. Accordingly, this study provides candidates for the design of novel 
      anti-infective and antineoplastic agents to fight multidrug-resistant bacteria and 
      malignant tumors and also offers additional clues for the taxonomy of ranid frogs.

TI  - Alanine Scanning Studies of the Antimicrobial Peptide Aurein 1.2.
PG  - 1042-1054
LID - 10.1007/s12602-018-9501-0 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are compounds widely distributed in nature that 
      display activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Amphibian skin, as an organ 
      rich in pharmacologically active peptides, appears to be an interesting source of 
      novel AMPs. Aurein 1.2 (GLFDIIKKIAESF-NH(2)) is a short 13-residue antimicrobial 
      peptide primarily isolated from the skin secretions of Australian bell frogs. In 
      this study, the alanine scan of aurein 1.2 was performed to investigate the effect 
      of each amino acid residue on its biological and physico-chemical properties. The 
      biological studies included determination of minimum inhibitory concentration, 
      activity against biofilm, and inhibitory effect on its formation. Moreover, the 
      hemolytic activity as well as serum stability was determined. The hydrophobicity of 
      peptides and their self-assembly were investigated using reversed-phase 
      chromatography. In addition, their helicity was calculated from circular dichroism 
      spectra. The results not only provided information on structure-activity 
      relationship of aurein 1.2 but also gave insights into design of novel analogs of 
      AMPs in the future.

TI  - The Location of the Antimicrobial Peptide Maculatin 1.1 in Model Bacterial 
      Membranes.

AB  - Maculatin 1.1 (Mac1) is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) from the skin secretions of 
      Australian tree frogs. In this work, the interaction of Mac1 with anionic 
      phospholipid bilayers was investigated by NMR, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, 
      neutron reflectometry (NR) and molecular dynamics (MD). In buffer, the peptide is 
      unstructured but in the presence of anionic (DPC/LMPG) micelles or (DMPC/DMPG/DHPC) 
      bicelles adopts a helical structure. Addition of the soluble paramagnetic agent 
      gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) into the Mac1-DPC/LMPG micelle solution showed that the 
      N-terminus is more exposed to the hydrophilic Gd-DTPA than the C-terminus in 
      micelles. (2)H and (31)P solid-state NMR showed that Mac1 had a greater effect on 
      the anionic lipid (DMPG). A deuterium labeled Mac1 used in NR experiments indicated 
      that the AMP spanned across anionic (PC/PG) bilayers, which was compatible with MD 
      simulations. Simulations also showed that Mac1 orientation remained transmembrane in 
      bilayers and wrapped on the surface of the micelles regardless of the lipid or 
      detergent charge. Thus, the peptide orientation appears to be more susceptible to 
      curvature than charged surface. These results support the formation of transmembrane 
      pores by Mac1 in model bacterial membranes.

TI  - The Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Potential of the Amphibian Peptide AR-23.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23020883 [doi]
LID - 883
AB  - Viral infections represent a serious threat to the world population and are becoming 
      more frequent. The search and identification of broad-spectrum antiviral molecules 
      is necessary to ensure new therapeutic options, since there is a limited 
      availability of effective antiviral drugs able to eradicate viral infections, and 
      consequently due to the increase of strains that are resistant to the most used 
      drugs. Recently, several studies on antimicrobial peptides identified them as 
      promising antiviral agents. In detail, amphibian skin secretions serve as a rich 
      source of natural antimicrobial peptides. Their antibacterial and antifungal 
      activities have been widely reported, but their exploitation as potential antiviral 
      agents have yet to be fully investigated. In the present study, the antiviral 
      activity of the peptide derived from the secretion of Rana tagoi, named AR-23, was 
      evaluated against both DNA and RNA viruses, with or without envelope. Different 
      assays were performed to identify in which step of the infectious cycle the peptide 
      could act. AR-23 exhibited a greater inhibitory activity in the early stages of 
      infection against both DNA (HSV-1) and RNA (MeV, HPIV-2, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV-2) 
      enveloped viruses and, on the contrary, it was inactive against naked viruses 
      (PV-1). Altogether, the results indicated AR-23 as a peptide with potential 
      therapeutic effects against a wide variety of human viruses.

TI  - Aggregation and Its Influence on the Bioactivities of a Novel Antimicrobial Peptide, 
      Temporin-PF, and Its Analogues.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22094509 [doi]
LID - 4509
AB  - Temporin is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) family discovered in the skin secretion 
      of ranid frog that has become a promising alternative for conventional antibiotic 
      therapy. Herein, a novel temporin peptide, Temporin-PF (TPF), was successfully 
      identified from Pelophylax fukienensis. It exhibited potent activity against 
      Gram-positive bacteria, but no effect on Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, TPF 
      exhibited aggregation effects in different solutions. Three analogs were further 
      designed to study the relationship between the aggregation patterns and 
      bioactivities, and the MD simulation was performed for revealing the pattern of the 
      peptide assembly. As the results showed, all peptides were able to aggregate in the 
      standard culture media and salt solutions, especially CaCl(2) and MgCl(2) buffers, 
      where the aggregation was affected by the concentration of the salts. MD simulation 
      reported that all peptides were able to form oligomers. The parent peptide assembly 
      depended on the hydrophobic interaction via the residues in the middle domain of the 
      sequence. However, the substitution of Trp/D-Trp resulted in an enhanced 
      inter-peptide interaction in the zipper-like domain and eliminated overall 
      biological activities. Our study suggested that introducing aromaticity at the 
      zipper-like domain for temporin may not improve the bioactivities, which might be 
      related to the formation of aggregates via the inter-peptide contacts at the 
      zipper-like motif domain, and it could reduce the binding affinity to the lipid 
      membrane of microorganisms.

AB  - Brevinins are an important antimicrobial peptide (AMP) family identified in the skin 
      of Ranidae frogs and generally contain a characteristic ranabox structure at their 
      C-terminal sequence. Herein a novel AMP named brevinin-2MP has been identified from 
      the skin of the frog Microhyla pulchra by molecular cloning. Brevinin-2MP 
      (GVITDTLKGVAKTVAAELLRKAHCKLTNSC) with a high amphipathic α-helix in sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate solutions can destroy bacterial cell membrane and kill microbes. 
      Furthermore, brevinin-2MP has been found to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS)-induced expression of pro-inflammatory NO, MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-α via binding 
      unidentified targets on the cell membrane and consequently suppressing the 
      activation of MAPK/NF-κB signaling cascades induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells. 
      Consistently, brevinin-2MP significantly alleviates the acute inflammatory response 
      in carrageenan-induced mice paw. In conclusion, brevinin-2MP with anti-inflammatory 
      and antimicrobial properties will be an ideal candidate drug molecule for bacterial 
      inflammation treatment.

PG  - 481-7
LID - 10.1007/s00726-012-1358-z [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptide diversity has been found in some amphibians. The diversity of 
      antimicrobial peptides may have resulted from the diversity of microorganisms 
      encountered by amphibians. Peptidomics and genomics analyses were used to study 
      antimicrobial peptide diversity in the skin secretions of the torrent frog, Amolops 
      jingdongensis. Thirty-one antimicrobial peptides belonging to nine groups were 
      identified in the skin secretions of this frog. Among them, there are two novel 
      antimicrobial groups (jingdongin-1 and -2) with unique structural motifs. The other 
      seven groups belong to known antimicrobial peptide families, namely brevinin-1, 
      brevinin-2, odorranain-F, esculentin-2, temporin, amolopin-3, and ranacyclin. 
      Combined with previous reports, more than 13 antimicrobial peptide groups have been 
      identified from the genus Amolops. Most of these antimicrobial peptide groups are 
      also found in amphibians belonging to the genus Rana or Odorrana which suggests a 
      possible evolutionary connection among Amolops, Rana, and Odorrana. Two novel 
      antimicrobial groups (jingdongin-1 and -2) were synthesized and their antimicrobial 
      activities were assayed. Some of them showed strong antimicrobial abilities against 
      microorganisms including Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, and fungi. The 
      extreme diversity of antimicrobial peptides in the Amolops amphibians was 
      demonstrated. In addition, several novel peptide templates were provided for 
      antimicrobial agent design.

AB  - The rise in antibiotic resistance has led to a renewed interest in antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) that target membranes. The mode of action of AMPs involves the 
      disruption of the lipid bilayer and leads to growth inhibition and death of the 
      bacteria. However, details at the molecular level of how these peptides kill 
      bacteria and the reasons for the observed differences in selectivity remain unclear. 
      Structural information is crucial for defining the molecular mechanism by which 
      these peptides recognize, self-assemble and interact with a particular lipid 
      membrane. Solid-state NMR is a non-invasive technique that allows the study of the 
      structural details of lipid-peptide and peptide-peptide interactions. Following on 
      from studies of antibiotic and lytic peptides, gramicidin A and melittin, 
      respectively, we investigated maculatin 1.1, an AMP from the skin of Australian tree 
      frogs that acts against Gram-positive bacteria. By using perdeuterated phospholipids 
      and specifically labelled peptides, (2) H, (31) P and {(31) P}(15) N REDOR 
      solid-state NMR experiments have been used to localize, maculatin 1.1 in neutral and 
      anionic model membranes. However, the structure, location and activity depend on the 
      composition of the model membrane and current advances in solid-state NMR 
      spectroscopy now allow structure determination of AMPs in live bacteria.

AB  - Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are cationic host defence peptides (HDPs) that 
      interact with microbial membranes. This ability may lead to implementation of AMPs 
      as therapeutics to overcome the wide-spread antibiotic resistance problem as the 
      affected bacteria may not be able to recover from membrane lysis types of attack. 
      AMP interactions with lipid bilayer membranes are typically explained through three 
      mechanisms, i.e., barrel-stave pore, toroidal pore and carpet models. Electrical 
      bilayer recording is a relatively simple and sensitive technique that is able to 
      capture the nanoscale perturbations caused by the AMPs in the bilayer membranes. 
      Molecular-level understanding of the behaviour of AMPs in relation to lipid bilayers 
      mimicking bacterial and human cell membranes is essential for their development as 
      novel therapeutic agents that are capable of targeted action against disease causing 
      micro-organisms. The effects of four AMPs (aurein 1.2, caerin 1.1, citropin 1.1 and 
      maculatin 1.1 from the skin secretions of Australian tree frogs) and the toxin 
      melittin (found in the venom of honeybees) on two different phospholipid membranes 
      were studied using the electrical bilayer recording technique. Bilayers composed of 
      zwitterionic (DPhPC) and anionic (DPhPC/POPG) lipids were used to mimic the charge 
      of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell membranes, respectively, so as to determine the 
      corresponding interaction mechanisms for different concentrations of the peptide. 
      Analysis of the dataset corresponding to the four frog AMPs, as well as the 
      resulting dataset corresponding to the bee toxin, confirms the proposed 
      peptide-bilayer interaction models in existing publications and demonstrates the 
      importance of using appropriate bilayer compositions and peptide concentrations for 
      AMP studies.

LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmx023 [doi]
AB  - The cDNAs encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the skin of Hylarana guentheri 
      were identified, namely temporin (five peptides, termed temporin-GHa-GHd and 
      temporin-GUa), brevinin-1 (one peptide, brevinin-1GUb), and brevinin-2 (eight 
      peptides, brevinin-2GHd-2GHj, and brevinin-2GHb). Eleven of the 14 peptides have 
      novel primary structures. Synthesized temporin GHa-GHd have broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and 
      Bacillus subtilis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio alginolyticus, 
      and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as fungus (Candida albicans). Among these 
      tested strains, S. aureus was the most sensitive to temporin-GHa-GHd with minimum 
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 6.8 and 12.9 μM. They also exhibited 
      antimicrobial activities against Methicillin-resistant S. aureus with the MIC 
      ranging from 12.7 to 51.7 μM. Interestingly, secondary structure prediction shows 
      that there is no α-helix in temporin-GHb, which illustrates that α-helix is not 
      required for the antimicrobial activity of temporin-GHb. NaCl (at final 
      concentrations of 0.15-2 M) decreased the antimicrobial activity of temporin-GHa-GHd 
      slightly, while human serum and S. aureus V8 proteinase had no effect on the 
      antimicrobial activity. Scanning electron microscopy images of E. coli and S. aureus 
      showed that the surface of microbial cells was considerably rough and shrived after 
      1 h of treatment with temporin-GHa-GHd at 37°C. The stabilities of temporin-GHa-GHd 
      in human serum or in S. aureus V8 proteinase make them to be promising candidates of 
      novel antimicrobial agents or models for the development of novel AMPs.

TI  - A consistent nomenclature of antimicrobial peptides isolated from frogs of the 
      subfamily Phyllomedusinae.
PG  - 2074-82
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.06.017 [doi]
AB  - A growing number of cationic antimicrobial peptides have been isolated from the skin 
      of hylid frogs belonging to the Phyllomedusinae subfamily. The amino acid sequences 
      of these peptides are currently located in several databases under identifiers with 
      no consistent system of nomenclature to describe them. In order to provide a 
      workable terminology for antimicrobial peptides from Phyllomedusid frogs, we have 
      made a systematic effort to collect, analyze, and classify all the Phyllomedusid 
      peptide sequences available in databases. We propose that frogs belonging to the 
      Phyllomedusinae subfamily should be described by the species names set out in 
      Amphibian Species of the World: 
      http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/index.php, American Museum of Natural 
      History, New York, USA. Multiple alignments analysis of at least 80 antimicrobial 
      peptides isolated from 12 Phyllomedusinae species were distributed in seven distinct 
      peptide families including dermaseptin, phylloseptin, plasticin, dermatoxin, 
      phylloxin, hyposin and orphan peptides, and will be considered as the name of the 
      headgroup of each family. The parent peptide's name should be followed by the first 
      upper letter of the species for orthologous peptides and publication date determines 
      priority. For example, the abbreviation B for bicolor and H for hypochondrialis. 
      When two species begin with the same letter, two letters in upper case should be 
      used (the first letter followed by the second or the third letter and so on). For 
      example, the abbreviation DI for distincta, DU for duellmani, VA for vaillanti and 
      VN for vanzolinii. Paralogous peptides should bear letter(s) in upper case followed 
      by numbers.

TI  - [Structure prediction and biological activity analysis of dybowskin-1ST 
      antimicrobial peptide in Rana dybowskii].
PG  - 2890-2902
LID - 10.13345/j.cjb.200564 [doi]
AB  - The evolution, structure and antigenic epitopes prediction of Rana dybowskii 
      antimicrobial peptide dybowskin-1ST were carried out using bioinformatics software 
      available online. Its antibacterial mechanism and structural properties were 
      analyzed, and its activity was verified by applying wound healing assay in mice and 
      bacteriostatic assay in vitro. This provides the theoretical basis for the 
      improvement of parental peptide and the development of novel derivative peptides. 
      The software MEGA_X were used to conduct homology alignment and to construct a 
      phylogenetic tree. The online software ProtParam, ProtScale, PeptideCutter, signal, 
      TMHMM Server were respectively used to predict the physicochemical parameters, 
      hydrophilia/hydrophobicity, shear sites, signal peptides, and transmembrane domains 
      of dybowskin-1ST. The online software SOPMA, Jpred4, DNAstar Protean were used to 
      predict the secondary structure of dybowskin-1ST, and SWISS-MODEL, I-TASSER were 
      used to predict the tertiary structure. ABCpred and SYFPEITHI were respectively used 
      to predict its B-and T-cell epitopes. The effect of dybowskin-1ST on the wound 
      healing was observed on experimental mice. Kirby-Bauer method and dilution method 
      were used to determine the bacteriostatic activity of dybowskin-1ST. The 
      dybowskin-1ST consists of 59 amino acid residues, of which leucine accounts for 
      16.9%, with a molecular formula of C₃₁₈H₅₁₀N₈₀O₉₃S₂. Its theoretical isoelectric 
      point is 5.10 and the charge is -2. The dybowskin-1ST and dybowskin-1CDYa are 
      closely related phylogenetically. The secondary structure of dybowskin-1ST predicted 
      by the three methods were similar, which consisted of α-helix (44.07%), extended 
      strand (16.95%), β-turns (3.39%), and random coil (35.39%). The prediction of 
      tertiary structure showed that dybowskin-1ST was mainly composed of α-helix, and it 
      was regarded as a hydrophilic protein with signal peptide sequence. Subcellular 
      localization analysis showed that the probability of secreting the mitochondrial 
      targeted peptides was 0.944. Dybowskin-1ST is an extracellular protein with no 
      transmembrane structure region, but contains seven phosphorylation sites, three 
      T-cell epitopes and eight B-cell epitopes. The dybowskin-1ST promoted wound healing 
      and effectively inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. 
      However, it had limited antibacterial activity against fungi and drug-resistant 
      bacteria. Although the structure of dybowskin-1ST is rich in α-helix, the 
      verification experiments showed that its antibacterial ability needs to be enhanced. 
      The reason may be that it is a negatively charged and hydrophilic protein, and amino 
      acid modification with the aim of increasing the number of positive charges and 
      changing the hydrophobicity may be used to obtain derived peptides with enhanced 
      activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While there is evidence of both purifying and balancing selection in 
      immune defense genes, large-scale genetic diversity in antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs), an important part of the innate immune system released from dermal glands in 
      the skin, has remained uninvestigated. Here we describe genetic diversity at three 
      AMP loci (Temporin, Brevinin and Palustrin) in two ranid frogs (Rana arvalis and R. 
      temporaria) along a 2000 km latitudinal gradient. We amplified and sequenced part of 
      the Acidic Propiece domain and the hypervariable Mature Peptide domain 
      (~ 150-200 bp) in the three genes using Illumina Miseq and expected to find 
      decreased AMP genetic variation towards the northern distribution limit of the 
      species similarly to studies on MHC genetic patterns. RESULTS: We found multiple 
      loci for each AMP and relatively high gene diversity, but no clear pattern of 
      geographic genetic structure along the latitudinal gradient. We found evidence of 
      trans-specific polymorphism in the two species, indicating a common evolutionary 
      origin of the alleles. Temporin and Brevinin did not form monophyletic clades 
      suggesting that they belong to the same gene family. By implementing codon evolution 
      models we found evidence of strong positive selection acting on the Mature Peptide. 
      We also found evidence of diversifying selection as indicated by divergent allele 
      frequencies among populations and high Theta k values. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      suggest that AMPs are an important source of adaptive diversity, minimizing the 
      chance of microorganisms developing resistance to individual peptides.

TI  - Antimicrobial Peptide Brevinin-1RL1 from Frog Skin Secretion Induces Apoptosis and 
      Necrosis of Tumor Cells.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26072059 [doi]
LID - 2059
AB  - Cancer has always been one of the most common malignant diseases in the world. 
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to find potent agents with selective antitumor 
      activity against cancer cells. It has been reported that antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs) can selectively target tumor cells. In this study, we focused on the 
      anti-tumor activity and mechanism of Brevinin-1RL1, a cationic α-helical AMP 
      isolated from frog Rana limnocharis skin secretions. We found that Brevinin-1RL1 
      preferentially inhibits tumor cells rather than non-tumor cells with slight 
      hemolytic activity. Cell viability assay demonstrated the intermolecular disulfide 
      bridge contributes to the inhibitory activity of the peptide as the antitumor 
      activity was abolished when the disulfide bridge reduced. Further mechanism studies 
      revealed that both necrosis and apoptosis are involved in Brevinin-1RL1 mediated 
      tumor cells death. Moreover, Brevinin-1RL1 induced extrinsic and mitochondria 
      intrinsic apoptosis is caspases dependent, as the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK 
      rescued Brevinin-1RL1 induced tumor cell proliferative inhibition. Immunohistology 
      staining showed Brevinin-1RL1 mainly aggregated on the surface of the tumor cells. 
      These results together suggested that Brevinin-1RL1 preferentially converges on the 
      cancer cells to trigger necrosis and caspase-dependent apoptosis and Brevinin-1RL1 
      could be considered as a pharmacological candidate for further development as 
      anti-cancer agent.

TI  - Effect of glucocorticoids on expression of cutaneous antimicrobial peptides in 
      northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens).
PG  - 191

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many species of frogs secrete cutaneous antimicrobial peptides that are 
      capable of killing Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Some of these species are 
      nonetheless susceptible to chytridiomycosis, suggesting that host factors causing 
      dysregulation of this innate immune response may be important in pathogenesis. Since 
      stresses, such as from environmental perturbations, are a potential cause of such 
      dysregulation, this study investigated the effect of glucocorticoid on cutaneous 
      gene expression of these antimicrobial peptides. RESULTS: Northern leopard frogs 
      (Lithobates pipiens) were injected with either the corticosteroid methylprednisolone 
      or saline every 48 h. Norepinephrine-elicited cutaneous secretions were collected 
      every 8 days for 40 days. Gene expression of antimicrobial peptides (brevinin-1P and 
      ranatuerin-2P) in the cutaneous secretions was measured relative to the reference 
      genes EF1-α and RPL8 using quantitative RT-PCR. Corticosteroid treatment was 
      associated with a significant increase in brevinin-1P gene expression, which was 
      most notable at 24-40 days of corticosteroid administration. Ranatuerin-2P 
      expression followed a similar but non-significant trend. CONCLUSION: This treatment 
      protocol, including corticosteroid-administration and frequent 
      norepinephrine-induced secretion, increased AMP gene expression in the skin of L. 
      pipiens under these experimental conditions. The findings do not support the 
      hypothesis that environmental stress predisposes frogs to chytridiomycosis by 
      causing glucocorticoid-induced suppression of antimicrobial peptide defences.

PG  - 827

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are multifunctional effector molecules 
      that often combine direct antimicrobial activities with signaling or 
      immunomodulatory functions. The skin secretions of anurans contain a variety of such 
      bioactive peptides. The identification of AMPs from frog species often requires 
      sacrificing several specimens to obtain small quantities of crude peptides, followed 
      by activity based fractionation to identify the active principles. RESULTS: We 
      report an efficient alternative approach to selectively amplify AMP-coding 
      transcripts from very small amounts of tissue samples, based on RNA extraction and 
      cDNA synthesis, followed by PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing of 
      size-selected amplicons. This protocol exploits the highly conserved signal peptide 
      region of the AMP precursors from Ranidae, Hylidae and Bombinatoridae for the design 
      of family-specific, forward degenerate primers, coupled with a reverse primer 
      targeting the mRNA poly-A tail. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the assembled sequencing 
      output allowed to identify more than a hundred full-length mature peptides, mostly 
      from Ranidae species, including several novel potential AMPs for functional 
      characterization. This (i) confirms the effectiveness of the experimental approach 
      and indicates points for protocol optimization to account for particular cases, and 
      (ii) encourages the application of the same methodology to other multigenic AMP 
      families, also from other genera, sharing common features as in anuran AMPs.

AB  - Defensins are one of the major families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and have 
      been reported from prokaryotic to eukaryotic kingdoms. But defensins are seldom 
      found in amphibian which is a major resource of novel AMPs. A novel defensin-like 
      AMP (defensin-TK) was isolated and characterized from skin secretions of the tree 
      frog Theloderma kwangsiensis. The cDNA encoding defensin-TK precursor was cloned 
      from the skin cDNA library of T. kwangsiensis. The deduced precursor of defensin-TK 
      was composed of three domains, a signal peptide of 16 residues, a spacer peptide of 
      1 residues and a mature peptide of 42 residues. The mature peptide of defensin-TK 
      shared the highest identity with the salamander (Cynops fudingensis) defensin 
      CFBD-1. The six conserved cysteines which formed intramolecular disulfide bonds of 
      defensins also exist in defensin-TK. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
      defensin-TK was closely related to fish β-defensins. Defensin-TK showed potent and 
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In addition, defensin-TK exerted a low 
      hemolytic activity on human red cells. These results suggested defensin-TK might 
      play an important role in defense the skin pathogenic microbes of tree frog T. 
      kwangsiensis, and might be a promising candidate for development of novel 
      antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Amphibian species face the growing threat of extinction due to the emerging fungal 
      pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis. 
      Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced in granular glands of the skin are an 
      important defense against this pathogen. Little is known about the ontogeny of AMP 
      production or the impact of AMPs on potentially beneficial symbiotic skin bacteria. 
      We show here that Rana (Lithobates) sphenocephala produces a mixture of four AMPs 
      with activity against B. dendrobatidis, and we report the minimum inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) of synthesized replicates of these four AMPs tested against 
      B. dendrobatidis. Using mass spectrometry and protein quantification assays, we 
      observed that R. sphenocephala does not secrete a mature suite of AMPs until 
      approximately 12 weeks post-metamorphosis, and geographically disparate populations 
      produce a different suite of peptides. Use of norepinephrine to induce maximal 
      secretion significantly reduced levels of culturable skin bacteria.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the skins of North American frogs.
PG  - 1556-63
LID - 10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.09.018 [doi]
AB  - North America is home to anuran species belonging to the families Bufonidae, 
      Eleutherodactylidae, Hylidae, Leiopelmatidae, Ranidae, and Scaphiopodidae but 
      antimicrobial peptides have been identified only in skin secretions and/or skin 
      extracts of frogs belonging to the Leiopelmatidae ("tailed frogs") and Ranidae 
      ("true frogs"). Eight structurally-related cationic alpha-helical peptides with 
      broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, termed ascaphins, have been isolated from 
      specimens of Ascaphus truei (Leiopelmatidae) occupying a coastal range. 
      Characterization of orthologous antimicrobial peptides from Ascaphus specimens 
      occupying an inland range supports the proposal that this population should be 
      regarded as a separate species A. montanus. Ascaphin-8 shows potential for 
      development into a therapeutically valuable anti-infective agent. Peptides belonging 
      to the brevinin-1, esculentin-1, esculentin-2, palustrin-1, palustrin-2, ranacyclin, 
      ranatuerin-1, ranatuerin-2, and temporin families have been isolated from North 
      American ranids. It is proposed that "ranalexins" represent brevinin-1 peptides that 
      have undergone a four amino acid residue internal deletion. Current taxonomic 
      recommendations divide North American frogs from the family Ranidae into two genera: 
      Lithobates and Rana. Cladistic analysis based upon the amino acid sequences of the 
      brevinin-1 peptides provides strong support for this assignment.

AB  - Skin secretion represents the only means of defense for the majority of frog 
      species. That phenomenon is based on the fact that the main components of the 
      secretion are peptides demonstrating greatly varying types of bioactivity. They 
      fulfill regulatory functions, fight microorganisms and may be even helpful against 
      predators. These peptides are considered to be rather promising pharmaceuticals of 
      future generation as according to the present knowledge microorganisms are unlikely 
      to develop resistance to them. Mass spectrometry sequencing of these peptides is the 
      most efficient first step of their study providing reliably their primary 
      structures, i.e., amino acids sequence and S-S bond motif. Besides discovering new 
      bioactive peptides, mass spectrometry appears to be an efficient tool of taxonomy 
      studies, allowing for distinguishing not only between closely related species, but 
      also between populations of the same species. Application of several tandem mass 
      spectrometry tools (CID, HCD, ETD, EThcD) available with Orbitrap mass analyzer 
      allowed us to obtain full sequence of about 60 peptides in the secretion of 
      Slovenian population of brown ranid frog Rana temporaria. The problem of sequence 
      inside C-terminal cycle formed by two Cys and differentiation of isomeric Leu and 
      Ile residues was done in top-down mode without any derivatization steps. Besides 
      general biomarkers of Rana temporaria species, Central Slovenian population of Rana 
      temporaria demonstrates six novel temporins and one brevinin 1, which may be treated 
      as biomarkers of that population.

TI  - Discovery of Distinctin-Like-Peptide-PH (DLP-PH) From the Skin Secretion of 
      Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis, a Prototype of a Novel Family of Antimicrobial 
      Peptide.
PG  - 541

AB  - Amphibian skin secretions are an important treasure house of bioactive antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs). Despite having been the focus of decades of research in this 
      context, investigations of phyllomedusine frogs continue to identify new AMPs from 
      their skin secretions. In this study, the prototype of a novel family of AMP 
      distinctin-like-peptide-PH (DLP-PH) was identified from the skin secretion of the 
      otherwise well-studied Tiger-Legged Tree Frog Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis through 
      cloning of its precursor-encoding cDNA from a skin secretion-derived cDNA library by 
      a 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) strategy. Subsequently, the mature 
      peptide was isolated and characterized using reverse-phase HPLC and MS/MS 
      fragmentation sequencing. DLP-PH adopted an α-helical conformation in membrane 
      mimetic solution and demonstrated unique structural features with two distinct 
      domains that differed markedly in their physiochemical properties. Chemically 
      synthesized replicates of DLP-PH showed antimicrobial activity against planktonic 
      bacterial and yeast cells, but more potent against Escherichia coli at 32 μg/mL. 
      However, DLP-PH showed much weaker inhibitory activity against the growth of sessile 
      cells in biofilms. In addition, DLP-PH exhibited anti-proliferative activity against 
      human cancer cell lines, H157, and PC3, but with no major toxicity against normal 
      human cell, HMEC-1. These combined properties make DLP-PH deserving further study as 
      an antimicrobial agent and further investigations of its structure-activity 
      relationship could provide valuable new insights into drug lead candidates for 
      antimicrobial and/or anti-cancer purposes.

TI  - Mechanistic aspects of peptide-membrane interactions determined by optical, 
      dielectric and piezoelectric techniques: an overview.
PG  - 543-55
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been isolated from a wide variety of organisms 
      that include microorganisms, plants, insects, frogs and mammals. As part of the 
      innate immune system expressed in many tissues, AMPs are able to provide protection 
      against invasion of foreign microorganisms and exhibit a broad spectrum of activity 
      against bacteria, fungi and/or virus. Non-AMPs cell-penetrating peptides have been 
      used as carriers for overcoming the membrane barrier and helping in the delivery of 
      various molecules into the cell. Physicochemical peptide-lipid interactions studies 
      can provide us with reliable molecular information about microbe defense response, 
      including the elucidation of the prevailing mechanisms of its action, such as the 
      barrel-stave, toroidal pore, carpet and detergent-like models. In this paper, we 
      present an overview of the peptide-lipid mechanisms of interaction as well as 
      discuss alternative techniques that could help to elucidate the peptides 
      functionality. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
      spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are useful techniques 
      to investigate in details of the peptide-membrane interaction. The techniques here 
      discussed could also offer specific and low-cost methods that can to shed some light 
      over the different modes of action of AMPs, contributing to the development of drugs 
      against infectious diseases.

TI  - Effect of amidation on the antimicrobial peptide aurein 2.5 from Australian southern 
      bell frogs.
PG  - 586-91
AB  - Aurein 2.5 is a naturally C-terminally amidated amphibian antimicrobial peptide. 
      C-terminal amidation can increase efficacy and hence a comparison was made between 
      aurein 2.5-CONH2 and its nonamidated analogue. Amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl 
      of aurein 2.5 enhanced antimicrobial activity 2.5- fold against Klebsiella 
      pneumonia. Our results demonstrate that both peptide analogues had high surface 
      activities (23 mN m-1for aurein 2.5-COOH and 26 mN m-1 aurein 2.5-CONH2). Circular 
      dichroism measurements suggest that the helical content of the amidated form, in the 
      presence of trifluoroethanol, was significantly enhanced (33.66 % for aurein 
      2.5-COOH and 60.89 % aurein 2.5-CONH2). The interaction of aurein 2.5 with bacterial 
      cell membrane mimics was investigated using Langmuir monolayers. Aurein 2.5-CONH2 
      induced stable surface pressure changes in monolayers formed from K. pneumonia 
      (circa 4.7 mN m-1), however, lower surface pressure changes were observed for aurein 
      2.5- COOH (circa 3.8 mN m-1). The data shows that in the case of aurein 2.5, 
      amidation is able to enhance antibacterial activity and it is proposed that the 
      increase in effectiveness is due to stabilization of the α-helical structure at the 
      membrane interface.

TI  - Evaluating the Bioactivity of a Novel Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Peptide 
      Brevinin-1GHa from the Frog Skin Secretion of Hylarana guentheri and Its Analogues.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10100413 [doi]
LID - 413
AB  - Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been identified from the skin secretion of 
      the frog Hylarana guentheri (H.guentheri), including Temporin, Brevinin-1, and 
      Brevinin-2. In this study, an antimicrobial peptide named Brevinin-1GHa was 
      identified for the first time by using 'shotgun' cloning. The primary structure was 
      also confirmed through mass spectral analysis of the skin secretion purified by 
      reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). There was a 
      Rana-box (CKISKKC) in the C-terminal of Brevinin-1GHa, which formed an 
      intra-disulfide bridge. To detect the significance of Rana-box and reduce the 
      hemolytic activity, we chemically synthesized Brevinin-1GHb (without Rana-box) and 
      Brevinin-1GHc (Rana-box in central position). Brevinin-1GHa exhibited a strong and 
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against seven microorganisms, while 
      Brevinin-1GHb only inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which 
      indicates Rana-box was necessary for the antimicrobial activity of Brevinin-1GHa. 
      The results of Brevinin-1GHc suggested transferring Rana-box to the central position 
      could reduce the hemolytic activity, but the antimicrobial activity also declined. 
      Additionally, Brevinin-1GHa demonstrated the capability of permeating cell membrane 
      and eliminating biofilm of S. aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Candida 
      albicans (C. albicans). The discovery of this research may provide some novel 
      insights into natural antimicrobial drug design.

TI  - Activation of the Bile Acid Pathway and No Observed Antimicrobial Peptide Sequences 
      in the Skin of a Poison Frog.
PG  - 581-589
LID - 10.1534/g3.118.200880 [doi]
AB  - The skin secretions of many frogs have genetically-encoded, endogenous antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs). Other species, especially aposematic poison frogs, secrete 
      exogenously derived alkaloids that serve as potent defense molecules. The origins of 
      these defense systems are not clear, but a novel bile-acid derived metabolite, 
      tauromantellic acid, was recently discovered and shown to be endogenous in poison 
      frogs (Mantella, Dendrobates, and Epipedobates). These observations raise questions 
      about the evolutionary history of AMP genetic elements, the mechanism and function 
      of tauromatellic acid production, and links between these systems. To understand the 
      diversity and expression of AMPs among frogs, we assembled skin transcriptomes of 13 
      species across the anuran phylogeny. Our analyses revealed a diversity of AMPs and 
      AMP expression levels across the phylogenetic history of frogs, but no observations 
      of AMPs in Mantella We examined genes expressed in the bile-acid metabolic pathway 
      and found that CYP7A1 (Cytochrome P450), BAAT (bile acid-CoA: amino acid 
      N-acyltransferase), and AMACR (alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase) were highly expressed 
      in the skin of M. betsileo and either lowly expressed or absent in other frog 
      species. In particular, CYP7A1 catalyzes the first reaction in the cholesterol 
      catabolic pathway and is the rate-limiting step in regulation of bile acid 
      synthesis, suggesting unique activation of the bile acid pathway in Mantella skin. 
      The activation of the bile acid pathway in the skin of Mantella and the lack of 
      observed AMPs fuel new questions about the evolution of defense compounds and the 
      ectopic expression of the bile-acid pathway.

TI  - Membrane interactions of Ocellatins. Where do antimicrobial gaps stem from?
PG  - 1241-1256
LID - 10.1007/s00726-021-03029-0 [doi]
AB  - The antimicrobial peptides Ocellatin-LB1, -LB2 and -F1, isolated from frogs, are 
      identical from residue 1 to 22, which correspond to the -LB1 sequence, whereas -LB2 
      carries an extra N and -F1 additional NKL residues at their C-termini. Despite the 
      similar sequences, previous investigations showed different spectra of activities 
      and biophysical investigations indicated a direct correlation between both 
      membrane-disruptive properties and activities, i.e., 
      ocellatin-F1 > ocellatin-LB1 > ocellatin-LB2. This study presents experimental 
      evidence as well as results from theoretical studies that contribute to a deeper 
      understanding on how these peptides exert their antimicrobial activities and how 
      small differences in the amino acid composition and their secondary structure can be 
      correlated to these activity gaps. Solid-state NMR experiments allied to the 
      simulation of anisotropic NMR parameters allowed the determination of the membrane 
      topologies of these ocellatins. Interestingly, the extra Asn residue at the 
      Ocellatin-LB2 C-terminus results in increased topological flexibility, which is 
      mainly related to wobbling of the helix main axis as noticed by molecular dynamics 
      simulations. Binding kinetics and thermodynamics of the interactions have also been 
      assessed by Surface Plasmon Resonance and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. 
      Therefore, these investigations allowed to understand in atomic detail the 
      relationships between peptide structure and membrane topology, which are in tune 
      within the series -F1 >  > -LB1 ≥ -LB2, as well as how peptide dynamics can affect 
      membrane topology, insertion and binding.

AB  - The amphibian skin plays an important role protecting the organism from external 
      harmful factors such as microorganisms or UV radiation. Based on biorational 
      strategies, many studies have investigated the cutaneous secretion of anurans as a 
      source of bioactive molecules. By a peptidomic approach, a novel antioxidant peptide 
      (AOP) with in vitro free radical scavenging ability was isolated from Physalaemus 
      nattereri. The AOP, named antioxidin-I, has a molecular weight [M+H](+) = 1543.69Da 
      and a TWYFITPYIPDK primary amino acid sequence. The gene encoding the antioxidin-I 
      precursor was expressed in the skin tissue of three other Tropical frog species: 
      Phyllomedusa tarsius, P. distincta and Pithecopus rohdei. cDNA sequencing revealed 
      highly homologous regions (signal peptide and acidic region). Mature antioxidin-I 
      has a novel primary sequence with low similarity compared with previously described 
      amphibian's AOPs. Antioxidin-I adopts a random structure even at high concentrations 
      of hydrophobic solvent, it has poor antimicrobial activity and poor performance in 
      free radical scavenging assays in vitro, with the exception of the ORAC assay. 
      However, antioxidin-I presented a low cytotoxicity and suppressed menadione-induced 
      redox imbalance when tested with fibroblast in culture. In addition, it had the 
      capacity to substantially attenuate the hypoxia-induced production of reactive 
      oxygen species when tested in hypoxia exposed living microglial cells, suggesting a 
      potential neuroprotective role for this peptide.

TI  - The contribution of skin antimicrobial peptides to the system of innate immunity in 
      anurans.
PG  - 201-12
LID - 10.1007/s00441-010-1014-4 [doi]
AB  - Cationic peptides with the propensity to adopt an amphipathic α-helical conformation 
      in a membrane-mimetic environment are synthesized in the skins of many species of 
      anurans (frogs and toads). These peptides frequently display cytolytic activities 
      against a range of pathogenic bacteria and fungi consistent with the idea that they 
      play a role in the host's system of innate immunity. However, the importance of the 
      peptides in the survival strategy of the animal is not clearly understood. It is a 
      common misconception that antimicrobial peptides are synthesized in the skins of all 
      anurans. In fact, the species distribution is sporadic suggesting that their 
      production may confer some evolutionary advantage to the organism but is not 
      necessary for survival. Although growth inhibitory activity against the chytrid 
      fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, responsible for anuran population declines 
      worldwide, has been demonstrated in vitro, the ability of frog skin antimicrobial 
      peptides to protect the animal in the wild appears to be limited and there is no 
      clear correlation between their production by a species and its resistance to fatal 
      chytridiomycosis. The low potency of many frog skin antimicrobial peptides is 
      consistent with the hypothesis that cutaneous symbiotic bacteria may provide the 
      major system of defense against pathogenic microorganisms in the environment with 
      antimicrobial peptides assuming a supplementary role in some species.

AB  - Most of amphibians belonging to family Rhacophoridae live in arboreal habitats. A 
      large number of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been identified from amphibian 
      skins. No antimicrobial peptide from Rhacophoridae amphibians has been reported. In 
      this study, we purified and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide, 
      pleurain-a1-thel from skin secretions of the tree frog, Theloderma kwangsiensis. Its 
      amino acid sequence was determined as RILTMTKRVKMPQLYKQIVCRLFKTC by Edman 
      degradation, mass spectrometry analysis and cDNA cloning. There are two cysteines, 
      which form an intra-molecular disulfide bridge, in the sequence of pleurain-a1-thel. 
      Pleurain-a1-thel exerted potential antimicrobial activities against wide spectrum of 
      microorganisms, including Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and fungi. It exerted 
      little hemolytic activity in human or rabbit red cells. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of antimicrobial peptide from Rhacophoridae 
      amphibians.

TI  - Solution structure of antimicrobial peptide esculentin-1c from skin secretion of 
      Rana esculenta.
PG  - 435-41
LID - 10.1007/s10059-010-0135-7 [doi]
AB  - Granular glands in the skins of frogs synthesize and secrete a remarkably diverse 
      range of peptides capable of antimicrobial activity. These anuran skin antimicrobial 
      peptides are commonly hydrophobic, cationic and form an amphipathic α-helix in a 
      membrane mimetic solution. Recently, they have been considered as useful target 
      molecules for developing new antibiotics drugs. Esculentin-1c is a 46-amino acid 
      residue peptide isolated from skin secretions of the European frog, Rana esculenta. 
      It displays the most potent antimicrobial activity among bioactive molecules. 
      Esculentin-1c has the longest amino acids among all antimicrobial peptides. The 
      present study solved the solution structure of esculentin-1c in TFE/water by NMR, 
      for the first time. We conclude that this peptide is comprised of three α-helices 
      with each helix showing amphipathic characteristics, which seems to be a key part 
      for permeating into bacterial membranes, thus presenting antimicrobial activity.

AB  - Little is known experimentally about the detailed orientation of membrane-bound 
      maculatin 1.1 (Mac1), an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of 
      Australian tree frogs. In this work multiple (15)N-labelled or (2)H-labelled Mac1 
      with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and isotropic DMPC/DHPC (q = 0.5) bicelles 
      were investigated by solution NMR, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, neutron 
      reflectometry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent. In 
      buffer, the (15)N-(1)H HSQC and CD spectra were indicative of the peptide being 
      random coiled. In the presence of micelles or isotropic bicelles, a unique and 
      helical peptide structure that was confirmed by CD was found. The titration of the 
      soluble paramagnetic agent gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) into the Mac1-DPC solution led to 
      enhanced relaxation of all (15)N labelled residues. The peptide N-terminus was more 
      exposed to Gd-DTPA than the C-terminus in micelles, while only the Gly-4 and Ala-18 
      resonances were significantly reduced in the presence of isotropic bicelles. MD 
      simulations of Mac1 fully inserted into a DPC micelle converged towards a solvent 
      exposed orientation and a topology where Mac1 was wrapped around the DPC micelle 
      with the more hydrophobic side facing inward. MD simulations of Mac1 fully inserted 
      into a phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayer converged towards a kinked transmembrane 
      orientation with water molecules penetrating around Lys-8. A deuterium labelled Mac1 
      used in neutron reflectometry experiments suggested a preferred orientation in 
      zwitterionic PC bilayers. These results give insight into the membrane disrupting 
      activity of Mac1 against cell membranes.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptide defenses of the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa).
PG  - 831-42
AB  - The mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) inhabits high elevation lakes in 
      California that are largely undisturbed by human activities. In spite of this 
      habitation in remote sites, populations continue to decline. Although predation by 
      non-native fish is one cause for declines, some isolated populations in fishless 
      lakes are suffering new declines. One possible cause of the current wave of declines 
      is the introduction of the pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis) which invades the adult skin to cause chytridiomycosis. In many 
      amphibian species, the skin is protected by antimicrobial peptides secreted into the 
      mucous. Here we show that R. muscosa produces three previously unknown antimicrobial 
      peptides belonging to the ranatuerin-2 and temporin-1 families of antimicrobial 
      peptides. These three peptides, along with bradykinin, are the most abundant 
      peptides in the skin secretions detected by mass spectrometry. Natural mixtures of 
      peptides and individual purified peptides strongly inhibit chytrid growth. The 
      concentration of total peptides recovered from the skin of frogs following a mild 
      norepinephrine induction is sufficient to inhibit chytrid growth in vitro. A 
      comparison of the species susceptibility to chytridiomycosis and the antichytrid 
      activity of peptides between R. muscosa and R. pipiens suggest that although R. 
      muscosa produces more total skin peptides, it appears to be more vulnerable to B. 
      dendrobatidis in nature. Possible differences in the antimicrobial peptide 
      repertoires and life history traits of the two species that may account for 
      differences in susceptibility are discussed.

TI  - Catesbeianin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin of Lithobates 
      catesbeianus (American bullfrog).
PG  - 897-903
LID - 10.1007/s10529-017-2312-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterize a novel antimicrobial peptide, 
      catesbeianin-1. RESULTS: Catesbeianin-1 is 25 amino acids long and is α-helical, 
      cationic and amphipathic. It had antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and 
      Gram-negative bacteria. It was resistant against trypsin and pepsin. Catesbeianin-1 
      exhibited moderate hemolytic activity (approx 8%) at 100 μg/ml, and its HC(50) (50% 
      hemolytic concentration) was 300 μg/ml. Its cytotoxicity was approx 10-20% at 
      100 μg/ml, and its CC(50) (50% cytotoxic concentration) was >100 μg/ml. The LD(50) 
      of catesbeianin-1 in mice was 80 mg/kg. At 3.1 µg/ml, catesbeianin-1 significantly 
      inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      new antimicrobial peptide from the skin of Lithobates catesbeianus (American 
      bullfrog) may represent a template for the development of novel antimicrobial 
      agents.

TI  - Enhanced Antimicrobial Activity of N-Terminal Derivatives of a Novel Brevinin-1 
      Peptide from The Skin Secretion of Odorrana schmackeri.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12080484 [doi]
LID - 484
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising therapeutic alternatives compared to 
      conventional antibiotics for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. 
      However, the application of the overwhelming majority of AMPs is limited because of 
      the high toxicity and high manufacturing costs. Amphibian skin secretion has been 
      proven to be a promising source for the discovery and development of novel AMPs. 
      Herein, we discovered a novel AMP from the skin secretion of Odorrana schmackeri, 
      and designed the analogues by altering the key factors, including conformation, net 
      charge and amphipathicity, to generate short AMPs with enhanced therapeutic 
      efficacy. All the peptides were chemically synthesised, followed by evaluating their 
      biological activity, stability and cytotoxicity. OSd, OSe and OSf exhibited 
      broad-spectrum antibacterial effects, especially OSf, which presented the highest 
      therapeutic index for the tested bacteria. Moreover, these peptides displayed good 
      stability. The results from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron 
      microscopy studies, indicated that brevinin-OS, OSd, OSe and OSf possessed rapid 
      bactericidal ability by disturbing membrane permeability and causing the release of 
      cytoplasmic contents. In addition, OSd, OSe and OSf dramatically decreased the 
      mortality of waxworms acutely infected with MRSA. Taken together, these data 
      suggested that a balance between positive charge, degrees of α-helicity and 
      hydrophobicity, is necessary for maintaining antimicrobial activity, and these data 
      successfully contributed to the design of short AMPs with significant bactericidal 
      activity and cell selectivity.

TI  - A novel antimicrobial peptide from amphibian skin secretions of Odorrana grahami.
PG  - 529-35
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.01.004 [doi]
AB  - A novel antimicrobial peptide named odorranain-NR was identified from skin 
      secretions of the diskless odorous frog, Odorrana grahami. It is composed of 23 
      amino acids with an amino acid sequence of GLLSGILGAGKHIVCGLTGCAKA. Odorranain-NR 
      was classified into a novel family of antimicrobial peptide although it shared 
      similarity with amphibian antimicrobial peptide family of nigrocin. Odorranain-NR 
      has an unusual intramolecular disulfide-bridged hexapeptide segment that is 
      different from the intramolecular disulfide-bridged heptapeptide segment at the 
      C-terminal end of nigrocins. Furthermore, the -AKA fragment at the C-terminal of 
      odorranain-NR is also different from nigrocins. Three different cDNAs encoding two 
      odorranain-NR precursors and only one mature odorranain-NR was cloned from the cDNA 
      library of the skin of O. grahami. This peptide showed antimicrobial activities 
      against tested microorganisms except Escherichia coli (ATCC25922). Its antimicrobial 
      mechanisms were investigated by transmission electron microcopy. Odorranain-NR 
      exerted its antimicrobial functions by various means depending on different 
      microorganisms.

AB  - African clawed frogs of the Xenopodinae (Xenopus+Silurana) constitute a well-defined 
      system in which to study the evolutionary trajectory of duplicated genes and are a 
      source of antimicrobial peptides with therapeutic potential. Allopolyploidization 
      events within the Xenopodinae have given rise to tetraploid, octoploid, and 
      dodecaploid species. The primary structures and distributions of host-defense 
      peptides from the tetraploid frogs Xenopus borealis, Xenopus clivii, Xenopus laevis, 
      Xenopus muelleri, "X. muelleri West", and Xenopus petersii may be compared with 
      those from the octoploid frogs Xenopus amieti and X. andrei. Similarly, components 
      in skin secretions from the diploid frog Silurana tropicalis may be compared with 
      those from the tetraploid frog Silurana paratropicalis. All Xenopus antimicrobial 
      peptides may be classified in the magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa), 
      caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) families. 
      However, the numbers of paralogs from the octoploid frogs were not significantly 
      greater than the corresponding numbers from the tetraploid frogs. Magainins were not 
      identified in skin secretions of Silurana frogs and the multiplicity of the PGLa, 
      CPF, and XPF peptides from S. paratropicalis was not greater than that of S. 
      tropicalis. The data indicate, therefore, that nonfunctionalization (gene silencing) 
      has been the most common fate of antimicrobial peptide genes following 
      polyploidization. While some duplicated gene products retain high antimicrobial 
      potency (subfunctionalization), the very low activity of others suggests that they 
      may be evolving towards a new biological role (neofunctionalization). CPF-AM1 and 
      PGLa-AM1 from X. amieti show potential for development into anti-infective agents 
      for use against antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Frogs secrete antimicrobial peptides onto their skin. We describe an assay to 
      preserve and analyze antimicrobial peptide transcripts from field-collected skin 
      secretions that will complement existing methods for peptide analysis. We collected 
      skin secretions from 4 North American species in the field in California and 2 
      species in the laboratory. Most frogs appeared healthy after release; however, Rana 
      boylii in the Sierra Nevada foothills, but not the Coast Range, showed signs of 
      morbidity and 2 died after handling. The amount of total RNA extracted from skin 
      secretions was higher in R. boylii and R. sierrae compared to R. draytonii, and much 
      higher compared to Pseudacris regilla. Interspecies variation in amount of RNA 
      extracted was not explained by size, but for P. regilla it depended upon collection 
      site and date. RNA extracted from skin secretions from frogs handled with bare hands 
      had poor quality compared to frogs handled with gloves or plastic bags. Thirty-four 
      putative antimicrobial peptide precursor transcripts were identified. This study 
      demonstrates that RNA extracted from skin secretions collected in the field is of 
      high quality suitable for use in sequencing or quantitative PCR (qPCR). However, 
      some species do not secrete profusely, resulting in very little extracted RNA. The 
      ability to measure transcript abundance of antimicrobial peptides in field-collected 
      skin secretions complements proteomic analyses and may provide insight into 
      transcriptional mechanisms that could affect peptide abundance.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from Phyllomedusa frogs: from biomolecular diversity to

AB  - Screening for new bioactive peptides in South American anurans has been pioneered in 
      frogs of the genus Phyllomedusa. All frogs of this genus have venomous skin 
      secretions, i.e., a complex mixture of bioactive peptides against potential 
      predators and pathogens that presumably evolved in a scenario of predator-prey 
      interaction and defense against microbial invasion. For every new anuran species 
      studied new peptides are found, with homologies to hormones, neurotransmitters, 
      antimicrobials, and several other peptides with unknown biological activity. From 
      Vittorio Erspamer findings, this genus has been reported as a "treasure store" of 
      bioactive peptides, and several groups focus their research on these species. From 
      1966 to 2009, more than 200 peptide sequences from different Phyllomedusa species 
      were deposited in UniProt and other databases. During the last decade, the emergence 
      of high-throughput molecular technologies involving de novo peptide sequencing via 
      tandem mass spectrometry, cDNA cloning, pharmacological screening, and surface 
      plasmon resonance applied to peptide discovery, led to fast structural data 
      acquisition and the generation of peptide molecular libraries. Research groups on 
      bioactive peptides in Brazil using these new technologies, accounted for the 
      exponential increase of new molecules described in the last decade, much higher than 
      in any previous decades. Recently, these secretions were also reported as a rich 
      source of multiple antimicrobial peptides effective against multidrug resistant 
      strains of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and virus, providing instructive lessons for 
      the development of new and more efficient nanotechnological-based therapies for 
      infectious diseases treatment. Therefore, novel drugs arising from the 
      identification and analysis of bioactive peptides from South American anuran 
      biodiversity have a promising future role on nanobiotechnology.

AB  - Natural drug discovery represents an area of research with vast potential. The 
      investigation into the use of naturally-occurring peptides as potential therapeutic 
      agents provides a new "chemical space" for the procurement of drug leads. Intensive 
      and systematic studies on the broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides found in 
      amphibian skin secretions are of particular interest in the quest for new 
      antibiotics to treat multiple drug-resistant bacterial infections. Here we report 
      the molecular cloning of the biosynthetic precursor-encoding cDNAs and respective 
      mature peptides representing a novel group of antimicrobial peptides from the skin 
      secretions of representative species of phyllomedusine leaf frogs: the Central 
      American red-eyed leaf frog (Agalychnis callidryas), the South American 
      orange-legged leaf frog (Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis) and the Giant Mexican leaf 
      frog (Pachymedusa dacnicolor). Each novel peptide possessed the highly-conserved 
      sequence, LGMIPL/VAISAISA/SLSKLamide, and each exhibited activity against the 
      Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus and the yeast, Candida albicans, but 
      all were devoid of haemolytic effects at concentrations up to and including the MICs 
      for both organisms. The novel peptide group was named medusins, derived from the 
      name of the hylid frog sub-family, Phyllomedusinae, to which all species 
      investigated belong. These data clearly demonstrate that comparative studies of the 
      skin secretions of phyllomedusine frogs can continue to produce novel peptides that 
      have the potential to be leads in the development of new and effective 
      antimicrobials.

TI  - Replacement of l-Amino Acids by d-Amino Acids in the Antimicrobial Peptide Ranalexin 
      and Its Consequences for Antimicrobial Activity and Biodistribution.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24162987 [doi]
LID - 2987
AB  - Infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are a global emerging problem. New 
      antibiotics that rely on innovative modes of action are urgently needed. Ranalexin 
      is a potent antimicrobial peptide (AMP) produced in the skin of the American 
      bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. Despite strong antimicrobial activity against 
      Gram-positive bacteria, ranalexin shows disadvantages such as poor pharmacokinetics. 
      To tackle these problems, a ranalexin derivative consisting exclusively of d-amino 
      acids (named danalexin) was synthesized and compared to the original ranalexin for 
      its antimicrobial potential and its biodistribution properties in a rat model. 
      Danalexin showed improved biodistribution with an extended retention in the 
      organisms of Wistar rats when compared to ranalexin. While ranalexin is rapidly 
      cleared from the body, danalexin is retained primarily in the kidneys. Remarkably, 
      both peptides showed strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria 
      and Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter with minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations (MICs) between 4 and 16 mg/L (1.9-7.6 µM). Moreover, both peptides 
      showed lower antimicrobial activities with MICs ≥32 mg/L (≥15.2 µM) against further 
      Gram-negative bacteria. The preservation of antimicrobial activity proves that the 
      configuration of the amino acids does not affect the anticipated mechanism of 
      action, namely pore formation.

TI  - Regulation of the Rana sylvatica brevinin-1SY antimicrobial peptide during 
      development and in dorsal and ventral skin in response to freezing, anoxia and 
      dehydration.
PG  - 1392-401
LID - 10.1242/jeb.092288 [doi]
AB  - Brevinin-1SY is the only described antimicrobial peptide (AMP) of Rana sylvatica. As 
      AMPs are important innate immune molecules that inhibit microbes, this study 
      examined brevinin-1SY regulation during development and in adult frogs in response 
      to environmental stress. The brevinin-1SY nucleotide sequence was identified and 
      used for protein modeling. Brevinin-1SY was predicted to be an amphipathic, 
      hydrophobic, alpha helical peptide that inserts into a lipid bilayer. Brevinin-1SY 
      transcripts were detected in tadpoles and were significantly increased during the 
      later stages of development. Effects of environmental stress (24 h anoxia, 40% 
      dehydration or 24 h frozen) on the mRNA levels of brevinin-1SY in the dorsal and 
      ventral skin were examined. The brevinin-1SY mRNA levels were increased in dorsal 
      and ventral skin of dehydrated frogs, and in ventral skin of anoxic frogs, compared 
      with controls (non-stressed). Brevinin-1SY protein levels in peptide extracts of 
      dorsal skin showed a similar, but not significant, trend to that of brevinin-1SY 
      mRNA levels. Antimicrobial activity of skin extracts from control and stressed 
      animals were assessed for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizopus stolonifer and Pythium sulcatum using disk 
      diffusion assays. Peptide extracts of dorsal skin from anoxic, frozen and dehydrated 
      animals showed significantly higher inhibition of E. coli and P. sulcatum than from 
      control animals. In ventral skin peptide extracts, significant growth inhibition was 
      observed in frozen animals for E. coli and P. sulcatum, and in anoxic animals for B. 
      cinerea, compared with controls. Environmental regulation of brevinin-1SY may have 
      important implications for defense against pathogens.

TI  - Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding antimicrobial peptide precursors from the skin 
      of the Chinese brown frog, Rana chensinensis.
PG  - 220-6

AB  - Skin plays a key role in the daily survival of amphibians. In the present study, six 
      cDNAs encoding amphibian skin antimicrobial peptide precursors from the Chinese 
      brown frog Rana chensinensis, were cloned and identified as preprobrevinin-1CEc, 
      preprobrevinin-1CEb, preprotemporin-1CEa, preprotemporin-1CEb, preprotemporin-1CEc, 
      and preprochensinin-1. Preprotemporin-1CEa, CEb, and CEc are members of the temporin 
      family, which are usually short, hydrophobic, and C-terminally alpha-amidated 
      antimicrobial peptides. Preprobrevinin-1CEa and CEb were identified as members of 
      the brevinin-1 family of antimicrobial peptides, because both peptides contain a 
      "Rana box" that is responsible for forming C-terminal Cys-bridged cyclic 
      heptapeptides. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of preprochensinin-1 
      were not similar to any known amphibian skin defensive peptides. Four bioactive 
      peptides were chemically synthesized according to the deduced amino acid sequences 
      of six prepropeptides from R. chensinensis skin, and their antimicrobial, cytotoxic, 
      and haemolytic properties were evaluated. All of the synthesized peptides inhibited 
      the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Brevinin-1CEa showed a broad spectrum of 
      antimicrobial activity. The novel amphibian skin peptide chensinin-1 was active 
      against Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus lactis at a concentration of 11.6 microM, 
      but did not inhibit the growth of MCF-7 and HeLa cells at 200 microM, and had no 
      haemolytic activity at a concentration of 500 microM. Temporin-1CEa exhibited the 
      greatest ability to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells. Its antimicrobial and 
      cytotoxic activities may be due to its high degree of alpha-helical confirmation and 
      amphipathic nature.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally produced, gene encoded molecules with a 
      direct antimicrobial activity against pathogens, often also showing other 
      immune-related properties. Anuran skin secretions are rich in bioactive peptides, 
      including AMPs, and we have reported a novel targeted sequencing approach to 
      identify novel AMPs simultaneously in different frog species, from small quantities 
      of skin tissue. Over a hundred full-length peptides were identified from specimens 
      belonging to five different Ranidae frog species, out of which 29 were novel 
      sequences. Six of these were selected for synthesis and testing against a panel of 
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. One peptide, identified in Rana arvalis, 
      proved to be a potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial, active against ATCC 
      bacterial strains and a multi-drug resistant clinical isolate. CD spectroscopy 
      suggests it has a helical conformation, while surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that 
      it may self-aggregate/oligomerize at the membrane surface. It was found to disrupt 
      the bacterial membrane at sub-MIC, MIC and above-MIC concentrations, as observed by 
      flow cytometry and/or visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Only a limited 
      toxicity was observed towards peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with a more 
      pronounced effect observed against the MEC-1 cell line.

AB  - The membrane interactions of four antimicrobial peptides, aurein 1.2, citropin 1.1, 
      maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1, isolated from Australian tree frogs, are reviewed. All 
      four peptides are amphipathic alpha-helices with a net positive charge and range in 
      length from 13 to 25 residues. Despite several similar sequence characteristics, 
      these peptides compromise the integrity of model membrane bilayers via different 
      mechanisms; the shorter peptides exhibit a surface interaction mechanism while the 
      longer peptides may form pores in membranes.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are key components of host immune defense of 
      vertebrates against microbial invasions. Here, we report a new AMP (esculentin-1GN) 
      characterized from the skin of the frog Hylarana guentheri. Esculentin-1GN 
      (GLFSKKGGKGGKSWIKGVFKGIKGIGKEVGGDVIRTGIEIAACKIKGEC) with high amphipathic α-helical 
      structure in membrane-mimetic environments has the microbial-killing activity by 
      destruction of the cell membrane. Moreover, esculentin-1GN inhibits LPS-induced 
      expression of proinflammatory nitric oxide, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor 
      necrosis factor while it enhances expression of interleukin-10. Furthermore, 
      esculentin-1GN can bind to d-(+)-galacturonic acid and LPS. Meanwhile, 
      esculentin-1GN suppresses the activation of inflammatory response pathway induced by 
      LPS. In addition, esculentin-1GN significantly reduces acute inflammation in 
      carrageenan-induced mice paw. Taken together, the novel LPS-binding esculentin-1GN 
      with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities will be an excellent temple for 
      designing new antibiotic formulations.

AB  - Dermaseptins are a group of α-helical shaped polycationic peptides isolated from the 
      Hylid frogs, with antimicrobial effects against bacteria, parasites, protozoa, 
      viruses in vitro. Besides, anti-tumor effects have been demonstrated. However, few 
      animal experiments and no clinical trials have been conducted thus far. This review 
      summarizes the current knowledge on the pharmacology, ethno pharmacology, 
      effectivity against infectious pathogens and tumors cells and the mechanism of 
      action of the Dermaseptins. Future research should focus on further clarification of 
      the mechanisms of action, the effectivity of Dermaseptins against several cancer 
      cell lines and their applicability in humans.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from ranid frogs: taxonomic and phylogenetic markers and a 
      potential source of new therapeutic agents.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Granular glands in the skins of frogs of the genus Rana, a widely distributed group 
      with over 250 species, synthesize and secrete a remarkably diverse array of peptides 
      with antimicrobial activity that are believed to have arisen as a result of multiple 
      gene duplication events. Almost without exception, these components are hydrophobic, 
      cationic and form an amphipathic alpha-helix in a membrane-mimetic solvent. The 
      peptides can be grouped into families on the basis of structural similarity. To 
      date, brevinin-1, esculentin-1, esculentin-2, and temporin peptides have been found 
      in ranid frogs of both Eurasian and North American origin; ranalexin, ranatuerin-1, 
      ranatuerin-2 and palustrin peptides only in N. American frogs; and brevinin-2, 
      tigerinin, japonicin, nigrocin and melittin-related peptides only in Eurasian frogs. 
      It is generally assumed that this structurally diversity serves to protect the 
      organism against a wide range of pathogens but convincing evidence in support of 
      this hypothesis is still required. The possibility that "antimicrobial peptides" 
      fulfill additional or alternative biological functions should not be rejected. The 
      molecular heterogeneity of the peptide families, particularly brevinin-1, brevinin-2 
      and ranatuerin-2, may be exploited for the purposes of unequivocal identification of 
      specimens and for an understanding of phylogenetic interrelationships between 
      species. The broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities of certain 
      peptides, for example esculentin-1, ranalexin-1 and ranatuerin, together with their 
      relatively low hemolytic activity, make them candidates for development into 
      therapeutically useful anti-infective agents.

TI  - Molecular cloning of novel antimicrobial peptide genes from the skin of the Chinese 
      brown frog, Rana chensinensis.
PG  - 112-7
LID - 10.2108/zsj.28.112 [doi]
AB  - One species of the Chinese brown frog, Rana chensinensis, is widely distributed in 
      north-central China. In this study, a cDNA library was constructed to clone the 
      antimicrobial peptides' genes from the skin of R. chensinensis. Twenty-three 
      prepropeptide cDNA sequences encoding twelve novel mature antimicrobial peptides 
      were isolated and characterized. Six peptides belonged to three known families 
      previously identified from other Ranid frogs: temporin (4 peptides), brevinin-2 (1 
      peptide), and palustrin-2 (1 peptide). The other six peptides showed little 
      similarity to known antimicrobial peptides. According to the amino acid sequences, 
      with or without α-helix structure, and either hydrophilic or hydrophobic, these were 
      organized into four new families: chensinin-1 (3 peptides), chensinin-2 (1 peptide), 
      chensinin-3 (1 peptide), and chensinin-4 (1 peptide). Five peptides from different 
      families were chemically synthesized, and their antimicrobial, cytolytic, and 
      hemolytic activities were evaluated. Of these, brevinin-2CE showed strongest 
      antimicrobial activities against both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria 
      with a slight hemolysis. Temporin-1CEe and palustrin-2CE also displayed a slight 
      hemolysis, but they had different activities to prokaryotic cells. Temporin-1CEe 
      showed higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than 
      Gram-negative bacteria, whereas it was contrary to palustrin-2CE. Chensinin-1 CEb 
      and chensinin-3CE only had moderate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms. 
      In addition, the brevinin-2 peptides from different brown frogs were analyzed to 
      reveal the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of R. chensinensis.

TI  - Identification and target-modifications of temporin-PE: A novel antimicrobial 
      peptide in the defensive skin secretions of the edible frog, Pelophylax kl. 
      esculentus.

AB  - A potent natural antimicrobial peptide named temporin-PE was identified and encoded 
      from the skin secretions of Pelophylax kl. esculentus via "shotgun" cloning and 
      LC-MS/MS fragmentation analysis. Target-modifications were carried out to further 
      enhance the antimicrobial and anti-proliferative bioactivities, whilst decreasing 
      the hemolytic effect. A range of bioassays demonstrated that replacing a proline 
      with a tyrosine residue resulted in a loss of the bioactivity against Gram-negative 
      bacteria, but dramatically improved the hemolytic and anti-proliferative activity, 
      indicating the FLP- motif influences the hemolytic activity of temporins. Moreover, 
      the coupling of TAT to the peptide dramatically improved its antimicrobial activity, 
      indicating coupling TAT to these peptides could be considered as a potential tool to 
      improve their antimicrobial activity. Overall, we have shown that targeted 
      modifications of this natural antimicrobial peptide can adjust its bioactivities to 
      help its development as an antibiotic or anti-proliferative agent.

TI  - Temporins: An Approach of Potential Pharmaceutic Candidates.
PG  - 309-322
LID - 10.1089/sur.2019.266 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also known as host defense peptides, are small and 
      mostly polycationic molecules that form part of the innate immune response. There 
      are currently more than 3000 experimentally reported AMPs. Particularly in frogs, 
      the temporin family has been discovered as potential AMPs. The aim of this work is 
      to review the latest publications about this class of peptides, discuss their 
      properties, and present an update of the last studies and new discoveries in the 
      field. More than 130 temporins have been identified in this family. The most studied 
      temporins are temporin A (TA), temporin B (TB), and temporin L (TL). These peptides 
      showed antimicrobial activity against gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and 
      fungi. Since the discovery of temporins in 1996, several groups of researchers 
      isolated different peptides from various species of frogs that were included as 
      members of this family. Although antimicrobial activity of many temporins has not 
      been analyzed yet, most of them showed antimicrobial and antifungal activities. A 
      combination of nanotechnology and AMPs for temporins in different antimicrobial 
      treatments could be a promising alternative for resistant pathogens. These studies 
      demonstrate that, even with the advancement in scientific research on the 
      composition and antimicrobial activity of temporins, further studies are necessary 
      to wholly understand their components and mechanisms of action.

TI  - Selection of antimicrobial frog peptides and temporin-1DRa analogues for treatment 
      of bacterial infections based on their cytotoxicity and differential activity 
      against pathogens.
PG  - 1103-1113
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.13569 [doi]
AB  - Cationic, amphipathic, α-helical host-defense peptides (HDPs) that are naturally 
      secreted by certain species of frogs (Anura) possess potent broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activity and show therapeutic potential as alternatives to treat 
      infections by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Fourteen amphibian skin peptides and 
      twelve analogues of temporin-1DRa were studied for their antimicrobial activities 
      against clinically relevant human or animal skin infection-associated pathogens. For 
      comparison, antimicrobial potencies of frog skin peptides against a range of 
      probiotic lactobacilli were determined. We used the VITEK 2 system to define a 
      profile of antibiotic susceptibility for the bacterial panel. The minimal inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) values of the naturally occurring temporin-1DRa, CPF-AM1, 
      alyteserin-1c, hymenochirin-2B, and hymenochirin-4B for pathogenic bacteria were 
      threefold to ninefold lower than the values for the tested probiotic strains. 
      Similarly, temporin-1DRa and its [Lys(4) ], [Lys(5) ], and [Aib(8) ] analogues 
      showed fivefold to 6.5-fold greater potency against the pathogens. In the case of 
      PGLa-AM1, XT-7, temporin-1DRa and its [D-Lys(8) ] and [Aib(13) ] analogues, no 
      apoptosis or necrosis was detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 
      concentrations below or above the MIC. Given the differential activity against 
      commensal bacteria and pathogens, some of these peptides are promising candidates 
      for further development into therapeutics for topical treatment of skin infections.

AB  - As drug-resistant bacteria have become a serious health problem and have caused 
      thousands of deaths, finding new antibiotics has become an urgent research priority. 
      A novel antimicrobial peptide, named Brevinin-1H, was identified in the skin 
      secretion of Amolops hainanensis through 'shotgun' cloning. It has broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activity against tested micro-organisms and has anticancer cell 
      activity. To improve its bioactivity and decrease its cytotoxicity, two structural 
      analogues-Brevinin-1Ha and Brevinin-1HY-were designed based on the secondary 
      structure of the natural peptide. Brevinin-1HY, in which tyrosine substituted 
      Pro(11) , had similar activity to the natural peptide against Gram-negative bacteria 
      and cancer cells, but showed a dramatic increase in haemolytic activity and 
      cytotoxicity at its minimum inhibitory concentration. Brevinin-1Ha, which 
      transferred the Rana-box from the C-terminal to a central position, had 
      significantly decreased haemolytic activity, but also in antimicrobial and 
      anticancer activity. The present data suggest that increasing the proportion of 
      α-helix structure in an AMP can increase its target micro-organism bioactivity to 
      some extent.

AB  - The skin innate immunities of diskless-fingered odorous frogs (Odorrana grahami) 
      from three populations were investigated. The antimicrobial capacities of skin 
      secretions against the 60 representative environmental bacterial strains were 
      evaluated using the values of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
      equivalents, which were defined as the volumes of antimicrobial solution just 
      inhibiting the tested bacteria per 1 cm(2) of surface area, from 0.06 to 
      9.10 mL/cm(2). Our results revealed significantly different skin antimicrobial 
      capacities among the three populations: Mianning < Huili < Kunming. Within the frog 
      population, the skin antimicrobial capacities are highly variable depending on the 
      season: in Mianning frogs, summer < autumn and spring; in Huili frogs, 
      spring < autumn < summer; in Kunming frogs, autumn < spring < summer. The animal 
      density and body mass significantly impacted the skin antimicrobial capacity, while 
      the sex ratio and soil or water bacterial counts did not.

TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of dermaseptin 01, a cationic antimicrobial 
      peptide, against Schistosoma mansoni.
PG  - 548-58

AB  - Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that remains a considerable public 
      health problem worldwide. Since the mainstay of schistosomiasis control is 
      chemotherapy with a single drug, praziquantel, drug resistance is a concern. Here, 
      we examined the in vitro effects of dermaseptin 01 (DS 01), an antimicrobial peptide 
      found in the skin secretion of frogs of the genus Phyllomedusa, on Schistosoma 
      mansoni adult worms. DS 01 at a concentration of 100 μg/ml reduced the worm motor 
      activity and caused the death of all worms within 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium. At the 
      highest sublethal concentration of antimicrobial peptide (75 μg/ml), a 100% 
      reduction in egg output of paired female worms was observed. Additionally, DS 01 
      induced morphological alterations on the tegument of S. mansoni, and a quantitative 
      analysis carried out by confocal microscopy revealed extensive destruction of the 
      tubercles in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range of 50-200 μg/ml. 
      It was the first time that an anthelmintic activity towards schistosomes has been 
      reported for a dermaseptin.

TI  - Structure-activity relationship of an antimicrobial peptide, Phylloseptin-PHa: 
      balance of hydrophobicity and charge determines the selectivity of bioactivities.
PG  - 447-458
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S191072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from the skin secretions of amphibians are 
      now considered as a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics. Phylloseptins 
      are a family of AMPs identified in the skin secretions of Phyllomedusinae tree frogs 
      which exhibit highly conserved structural characteristics. This study examines the 
      structure-activity relationship of the newly discovered phylloseptin, 
      Phylloseptin-PHa (PSPHa) from Pithecopus hypochondrialis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      PSPHa and modified analogs were produced by solid phase synthesis and purified by 
      reverse-phase HPLC. Rationally designed modified analogs incorporating changes in 
      significant physicochemical parameters such as hydrophobicity, hydrophobic moment 
      and net charge were investigated to determine their influence on secondary 
      structure, antimicrobial activity, membrane permeabilization and cytotoxicity. 
      RESULTS: Overall, we found that when rationally designing AMPs by altering their 
      primary structure it is important to keep a balance between hydrophobicity and 
      charge. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights which will help in the future 
      development of AMPs as alternatives to conventional antibiotics for the treatment of 
      Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.

TI  - Effects of C-terminal amidation and heptapeptide ring on the biological activities 
      and advanced structure of amurin-9KY, a novel antimicrobial peptide identified from 
      the brown frog, Rana kunyuensis.
PG  - 198-204
LID - 10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2018.070 [doi]
AB  - Rana kunyuensis is a species of brown frog that lives exclusively on Kunyu Mountain, 
      Yantai, China. In the current study, a 279-bp cDNA sequence encoding a novel 
      antimicrobial peptide (AMP), designated as amurin-9KY, was cloned from synthesized 
      double-strand skin cDNA of R. kunyuensis. The amurin-9KY precursor was composed of 
      62 amino acid (aa) residues, whereas the mature peptide was composed of 14 aa and 
      contained two cysteines forming a C-terminal heptapeptide ring (Rana box domain) and 
      an amidated C-terminus. These structural characters represent a novel amphibian AMP 
      family. Although amurin-9KY exhibited high similarity to the already identified 
      amurin-9AM from R. amurensis, little is known about the structures and activities of 
      amurin-9 family AMPs so far. Therefore, amurin-9KY and its three derivatives 
      (amurin-9KY1-3) were designed and synthesized. The structures and activities were 
      examined to evaluate the influence of C-terminal amidation and the heptapeptide ring 
      on the activities and structure of amurin-9KY. Results indicated that C-terminal 
      amidation was essential for antimicrobial activity, whereas both C-terminal 
      amidation and the heptapeptide ring played roles in the low hemolytic activity. 
      Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that the four peptides adopted an a-helical 
      conformation in THF/H2O (v/v 1:1) solution, but a random coil in aqueous solution. 
      Elimination of the C-terminal heptapeptide ring generated two free cysteine residues 
      with unpaired thiol groups, which greatly increased the concentration-dependent 
      anti-oxidant activity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also performed to 
      determine the possible bactericidal mechanisms.

AB  - While natural antimicrobial peptides are potential therapeutic agents, their 
      physicochemical properties and bioactivity generally need to be enhanced for 
      clinical and commercial development. We have previously developed a cationic, 
      amphipathic α-helical, 11-residue peptide (named herein GA-W2: FLGWLFKWASK-NH₂) with 
      potent antimicrobial and hemolytic activity, which was derived from a 24-residue, 
      natural antimicrobial peptide isolated from frog skin. Here, we attempted to 
      optimize peptide bioactivity by a rational approach to sequence modification. Seven 
      analogues were generated from GA-W2, and their activities were compared with that of 
      a 12-residue peptide, omiganan, which is being developed for clinical and commercial 
      applications. Most of the modifications reported here improved antimicrobial 
      activity. Among them, the GA-K4AL (FAKWAFKWLKK-NH₂) peptide displayed the most 
      potent antimicrobial activity with negligible hemolytic activity, superior to that 
      of omiganan. The therapeutic index of GA-K4AL was improved more than 53- and more 
      than 31-fold against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, 
      compared to that of the starting peptide, GA-W2. Given its relatively shorter length 
      and simpler amino acid composition, our sequence-optimized GA-K4AL peptide may thus 
      be a potentially useful antimicrobial peptide agent.

AB  - The membrane destabilising properties of the antimicrobial peptides (AMP) aurein 
      1.2, citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1, have been studied by dual 
      polarisation interferometry (DPI). The overall process of peptide induced membrane 
      destabilisation was examined by the changes in bilayer order as a function of 
      membrane-bound peptide mass per unit area and revealed three different modes of 
      action. Aurein 1.2 was the only peptide that significantly destabilised the neutral 
      membrane (DMPC), while all four peptides induced destabilisation of the negatively 
      charged membrane (DMPC/DMPG). On DMPC, citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1 
      bound irreversibly at low concentrations but caused a reversible drop in the bilayer 
      order. In contrast to DMPC/DMPG, these three peptides caused a mass drop at the 
      higher concentrations, which may correspond to insertion and bilayer expansion. The 
      critical level of bound peptide necessary to induce membrane destabilisation 
      (peptide:lipid ratio) was determined and correlated with peptide structure. As the 
      most lytic peptide, aurein 1.2 adsorbed strongly prior to dissolution of the 
      bilayer. In contrast, the binding of citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1 
      needed to reach a critical level prior to insertion into the membrane and 
      incremental expansion and disruption. Our results demonstrate that sequential events 
      can be monitored in real-time under fluidic conditions to elucidate the complex 
      molecular mechanism of AMP action. In particular, the analysis of birefringence in 
      real time allows the description of a detailed mechanistic model of the impact of 
      peptides on the membrane bilayer order. This article is part of a Special Issue 
      entitled: Interfacially Active Peptides and Proteins. Guest Editors: William C.

TI  - Identification and Characterisation of the Antimicrobial Peptide, Phylloseptin-PT, 
      from the Skin Secretion of Phyllomedusa tarsius, and Comparison of Activity with 
      Designed, Cationicity-Enhanced Analogues and Diastereomers.
LID - 1667
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides belonging to the phylloseptin family are mainly found in 
      phyllomedusine frogs. These peptides not only possess potent antimicrobial activity 
      but exhibit low toxicity against eukaryotic cells. Therefore, they are considered as 
      promising drug candidates for a number of diseases. In a recent study, potent 
      antimicrobial activity was correlated with the conserved structures and cationic 
      amphiphilic characteristics of members of this peptide family. A phylloseptin 
      peptide precursor was discovered here in the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa tarsius 
      and the mature peptide was validated by MS/MS sequencing, and was subsequently named 
      phylloseptin-PT. The chemically-synthesized and purified phylloseptin-PT displayed 
      activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Nevertheless, a range 
      of cationicity-enhanced peptide analogues of phylloseptin-PT, which contained amino 
      acid substitutions at specific sites, exhibited significant increases in 
      antimicrobial activity compared to native phylloseptin-PT. In addition, alternative 
      conformers which were designed and chemically-synthesized with d-lysine, showed 
      potent antimicrobial activity and enhanced bioavailability. These data indicate that 
      phylloseptins may represent potential candidates for next-generation antibiotics. 
      Thus, rational design through modification of natural antimicrobial peptide 
      templates could provide an accelerated path to overcoming obstacles en-route to 
      their possible clinical applications.

TI  - Membrane interactions of antimicrobial peptides from Australian tree frogs.
PG  - 1178-83
AB  - The skin secretions of amphibians are rich in host defence peptides. The membrane 
      interactions of the antimicrobial peptides, aurein 1.2, citropin 1.1 and maculatin 
      1.1, isolated from Australian tree frogs, are reviewed. Although all three peptides 
      are amphipathic alpha-helices, the mode of action of these membrane-active peptides 
      is not defined. The peptides have a net positive charge and range in length from 13 
      to 21 residues, with the longest, maculatin 1.1, having a proline at position 15. 
      Interestingly, alanine substitution at Pro-15 leads to loss of activity. The effects 
      of these peptides on phospholipid bilayers indicate different mechanisms for pore 
      formation and lysis of model membranes, with the shorter peptides exhibiting a 
      carpet-like mechanism and the longest peptide forming pores in phospholipid bilayer 
      membranes.

      Chinese odorous frogs.

LID - 10.1021/pr200782u [doi]
AB  - Peptide agents are regarded as hopeful candidates to solve life-threatening 
      resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to classic antibiotics due to their unique 
      action mechanisms. Peptidomic and genomic investigation of natural antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) from amphibian skin secretions can provide a large amount of 
      structure-functional information to design peptide antibiotics with therapeutic 
      potential. In the present study, we identified a large number of AMPs from the skins 
      of nine kinds of Chinese odorous frogs. Eighty AMPs were purified from three 
      different odorous frogs and confirmed by peptidomic analysis. Our results indicated 
      that post-translational modification of AMPs rarely happened in odorous frogs. cDNAs 
      encoding precursors of 728 AMPs, including all the precursors of the confirmed 80 
      native peptides, were cloned from the constructed AMP cDNA libraries of nine Chinese 
      odorous frogs. On the basis of the sequence similarity of deduced mature peptides, 
      these 728 AMPs were grouped into 97 different families in which 71 novel families 
      were identified. Out of these 728 AMPs, 662 AMPs were novel and 28 AMPs were 
      reported previously in other frog species. Our results revealed that identical AMPs 
      were widely distributed in odorous frogs; 49 presently identified AMPs could find 
      their identical molecules in different amphibian species. Purified peptides showed 
      strong antimicrobial activities against 4 tested microbe strains. Twenty-three 
      deduced peptides were synthesized and their bioactivities, including antimicrobial, 
      antioxidant, hemolytic, immunomodulatory and insulin-releasing activities, were 
      evaluated. Our findings demonstrate the extreme diversity of AMPs in amphibian skins 
      and provide plenty of templates to develop novel peptide antibiotics.

AB  - The dermaseptin peptides, mainly derived from the skin secretions of Hylidae frogs, 
      belong to a superfamily of antimicrobial peptides and exhibit diverse antimicrobial 
      and anticancer activities with low cytotoxicity. Here, we reported a novel 
      dermaseptin peptide, from the South American orange-legged leaf frogs, Pithecopus 
      (Phyllomedusa) hypochondrialis, processing the shortest peptide length, namely 
      Dermaseptin-PH. The complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding biosynthetic precursor of 
      Dermaseptin-PH was initially identified by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR 
      (RACE-PCR) technique from the skin secretion. The predicted primary structure was 
      confirmed by a combination of reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography 
      (RP-HPLC) and MS/MS fragmentation from the skin secretion. Chemically-synthetic 
      Dermaseptin-PH was investigated using a range of bioactivity assessment assays to 
      evaluate the biological activities and cytotoxicity of Dermaseptin-PH. 
      Dermaseptin-PH inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive 
      bacteria, and pathogenic yeast Candidaalbicans. In addition, Dermaseptin-PH showed a 
      broad-spectrum of anticancer activities against several cancer cell lines including 
      MCF-7, H157, U251MG, MDA-MB-435S, and PC-3. The potent antimicrobial and anticancer 
      activities of Dermaseptin-PH make it a promising candidate in the discovery of new 
      drugs for clinical applications, and the relatively short sequence of Dermaseptin-PH 
      can provide new insight for the research and structural modification of new peptide 
      drugs.

TI  - Cloning from tissue surrogates: antimicrobial peptide (esculentin) cDNAs from the 
      defensive skin secretions of Chinese ranid frogs.
PG  - 638-44
AB  - The defensive skin secretions of amphibians are a rich source of bioactive peptides. 
      Here we describe a rapid technique for skin granular gland transcriptome cloning 
      from a surrogate tissue-the secretion itself. cDNA libraries were constructed from 
      lyophilized skin secretion from each of the Chinese frogs (Rana schmackeri, Rana 
      versabilis, and Rana plancyi fukienensis) using magnetic oligo(dT) bead-captured 
      polyadenylated mRNA as templates. Specific esculentin cDNAs were amplified by 
      3'-RACE using a degenerate primer designed for a consensus nucleotide sequence in 
      the 5' untranslated region of previously characterized ranid frog peptide cDNAs. The 
      cloned cDNAs were found to encode the antimicrobial peptides esculentins 1 and 2 
      from each of the species examined. The presence of predicted peptide structures in 
      skin secretions was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and automated Edman 
      degradation. This experimental approach can thus rapidly expedite parallel 
      transcriptome and peptidome analysis of amphibian granular gland secretions without 
      harming or sacrificing donor animals.

TI  - Hylaranins: prototypes of a new class of amphibian antimicrobial peptide from the 
      skin secretion of the oriental broad-folded frog, Hylarana latouchii.
PG  - 901-9
LID - 10.1007/s00726-013-1655-1 [doi]
AB  - Amphibian skin secretions contain a broad spectrum of biologically active compounds, 
      particularly antimicrobial peptides, which are considered to constitute a first line 
      of defence against bacterial infection. Here we describe the identification of two 
      prototype peptides representing a novel structural class of antimicrobial peptide 
      from the skin secretion of the oriental broad-folded frog, Hylarana latouchii. Named 
      hylaranin-L1 (GVLSAFKNALPGIMKIIVamide) and hylaranin-L2 (GVLSVIKNALPGIMRFIAamide), 
      both peptides consist of 18 amino acid residues, are C-terminally amidated and are 
      of unique primary structures. Their primary structures were initially deduced by 
      MS/MS fragmentation sequencing from reverse-phase HPLC fractions of skin secretion 
      that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. Subsequently, their precursor-encoding 
      cDNAs were cloned from a skin secretion-derived cDNA library and their primary 
      structures were confirmed unequivocally. Synthetic replicates of both peptides 
      exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity with mean inhibitory concentrations 
      (MICs) of 34 μM against Gram-negative Escherichia coli, 4.3 μM against Gram-positive 
      Staphylococcus aureus and 4-9 μM against the yeast, Candida albicans. Both peptides 
      exhibited little haemolytic activity (<6%) at the MICs for S. aureus and C. 
      albicans. Amphibian skin secretions thus continue to provide novel antimicrobial 
      peptide structures that may prove to be lead compounds in the design of new classes 
      of anti-infection therapeutics.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptide defenses of the Tarahumara frog, Rana tarahumarae.
PG  - 361-7
AB  - Populations of the Tarahumara frog Rana tarahumarae have decreased markedly in 
      recent years in the northern part of their range. Infection by the chytrid fungus 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been implicated in these declines. To determine 
      whether antimicrobial peptides in the skin provide protection against this pathogen, 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were tested for their ability to inhibit 
      growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro. After concentration, crude mixtures of skin 
      peptides inhibited the growth of the chytrid in a concentration-dependent manner. 
      Proteomic analysis led to the identification and characterization of three peptides 
      belonging to the brevinin-1 family of antimicrobial peptides and three belonging to 
      the ranatuerin-2 family. The two most abundant peptides, ranatuerin-2TRa 
      (GIMDSIKGAAKEIAGHLLDNLKCKITGC) and brevinin-1TRa (FLPVIAGIAANVLPKLFCKLTKRC), were 
      active against B. dendrobatidis (MIC of 50 microM for ranatuerin-2TRa and 12.5 
      microM for brevinin-1TRa against zoospores). These data clearly show that 
      antimicrobial peptides in the skin secretions of the Tarahumara frog are active 
      against B. dendrobatidis and should provide some protection against infection. 
      Therefore, the observed susceptibility of these frogs to this pathogen in the wild 
      may be due to the effects of additional environmental factors that impair this 
      innate defense mechanism, leading to the observed population declines.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretion of the frog Leptodactylus syphax.
PG  - 572-80
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are considered part of the innate immune system of the 
      majority of living organisms. Most of these molecules are small, cationic and show 
      amphiphilic nature. The skin secretions of Leptodactylus syphax were extracted by 
      mild electrical stimulation and its semipreparative reverse-phase chromatography was 
      resolved in more than 40 fractions. Among these fractions, an antimicrobial peptide 
      was isolated and its amino acid sequence determined by de novo sequencing. Six other 
      truncated forms were characterized in skin secretion. The longest one (25 amino acid 
      residues), named syphaxin (SPX), is amidated at the C-terminal, and shares strong 
      sequence similarity with antimicrobial peptides found in the skin secretion of 
      leptodactylid frogs. Two of the truncated peptides (SPX(1-22) and SPX(1-16)) were 
      tested against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, showing low minimal 
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) and no significant toxicity towards blood cells, 
      including both leukocytes and erythrocytes, based on their direct incubation in 
      whole blood at the highest MIC concentration (64 microg/mL).

TI  - Differential Interaction of Antimicrobial Peptides with Lipid Structures Studied by 
      Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22101775 [doi]
LID - 1775
AB  - In this work; we investigated the differential interaction of amphiphilic 
      antimicrobial peptides with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) 
      lipid structures by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations. By using a 
      coarse-grained (CG) model within the MARTINI force field; we simulated the 
      peptide-lipid system from three different initial configurations: (a) peptides in 
      water in the presence of a pre-equilibrated lipid bilayer; (b) peptides inside the 
      hydrophobic core of the membrane; and (c) random configurations that allow 
      self-assembled molecular structures. This last approach allowed us to sample the 
      structural space of the systems and consider cooperative effects. The peptides used 
      in our simulations are aurein 1.2 and maculatin 1.1; two well-known antimicrobial 
      peptides from the Australian tree frogs; and molecules that present different 
      membrane-perturbing behaviors. Our results showed differential behaviors for each 
      type of peptide seen in a different organization that could guide a molecular 
      interpretation of the experimental data. While both peptides are capable of forming 
      membrane aggregates; the aurein 1.2 ones have a pore-like structure and exhibit a 
      higher level of organization than those conformed by maculatin 1.1. Furthermore; 
      maculatin 1.1 has a strong tendency to form clusters and induce curvature at low 
      peptide-lipid ratios. The exploration of the possible lipid-peptide structures; as 
      the one carried out here; could be a good tool for recognizing specific 
      configurations that should be further studied with more sophisticated methodologies.

AB  - Antibacterial peptide can be easily degraded by protease and has the lethal effect 
      on the host Escherichia coli. In order to solve these problems and further improve 
      the expression ability of the Escherichia coli system, the antimicrobial peptide 
      Spinosan-C of Paa spinosa was studied. First, the codon of Spinosan-C was optimized 
      according to E. coli codon usage frequency. Then, the 8 multimeric Spinosan-C gene 
      (8×Spinosan-C) was synthesized and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector 
      pET-28a. The fusion antimicrobial peptide 8×Spinosan-C was further highly expressed 
      in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta. The recombinant 8×Spinosan-C protein was then 
      purified and cleaved specially by formic acid to generate the Spinosan-C monomer. 
      Antibacterial test in vitro suggested that the cleaved Spinosan-C monomer had 
      antibacterial bioactivity against the test bacteria. This study provides a technical 
      reference for the largescale preparation of frog antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Brevinin-2GHk from Sylvirana guentheri and the Design of Truncated Analogs 
      Exhibiting the Enhancement of Antimicrobial Activity.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics9020085 [doi]
LID - 85
AB  - Brevinins are an important antimicrobial peptide (AMP) family discovered in the skin 
      secretions of Ranidae frogs. The members demonstrate a typical C-terminal ranabox, 
      as well as a diverse range of other structural characteristics. In this study, we 
      identified a novel brevinin-2 peptide from the skin secretion of Sylvirana 
      guentheri, via cloning transcripts, and identifying the expressed mature peptide, in 
      the skin secretion. The confirmed amino acid sequence of the mature peptide was 
      designated brevinin-2GHk (BR2GK). Moreover, as a previous study had demonstrated 
      that the N-terminus of brevinin-2 is responsible for exerting antimicrobial 
      activity, we also designed a series of truncated derivatives of BR2GK. The results 
      show that the truncated derivatives exhibit significantly improved antimicrobial 
      activity and cytotoxicity compared to the parent peptide, except a Pro(14) 
      substituted analog. The circular dichroism (CD) analysis of this analog revealed 
      that it did not fold into a helical conformation in the presence of either 
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or TFE, indicating that position 14 is involved in the 
      formation of the α-helix. Furthermore, three more analogs with the substitutions of 
      Ala, Lys and Arg at the position 14, respectively, revealed the influence on the 
      membrane disruption potency on bacteria and mammalian cells by the structural 
      changes at this position. Overall, the N-terminal 25-mer truncates demonstrated the 
      potent antimicrobial activity with low cytotoxicity.

PG  - 157-62
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are effector molecules of the innate immunity of amphibians. 
      Here, one antimicrobial peptide cDNA precursor, prepropalustrin-2CE3, from the 
      tadpole of the Chinese brown frog Rana chensinensis was cloned. The coding sequence 
      corresponding to the mature palustrin-2CE peptide was subcloned into pGEX-6p-1. The 
      soluble GST-palustrin-2CE fusion protein was successfully expressed in the 
      BL21(DE3)pLysS strain at 16 °C, and the proportion of the fusion protein reached 
      35%-39% of the total cellular protein. After removal of the GST-fusion tag, the 
      purity of the palustrin-2CE obtained by Sephadex G50 chromatography was about 97%. 
      Moreover, the purified palustrin-2CE displayed obviously inhibitory activities 
      against the sensitive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, and multi-drug resistant S. aureus and E. coli. 
      These findings suggest that the tadpole of the Chinese brown frog is a unique source 
      of antimicrobial peptides and indicates the therapeutic potential of the 
      palustrin-2CE peptide.

TI  - Characterization of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the Malaysian 
      frogs, Odorrana hosii and Hylarana picturata (Anura:Ranidae).
PG  - 465-73
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.06.017 [doi]
AB  - Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from Hose's rock 
      frog Odorrana hosii (Boulenger, 1891) led to the isolation of 8 peptides with 
      differential antibacterial activities. Structural characterization demonstrated that 
      the peptides belonged to the esculentin-1 (1 peptide), esculentin-2 (1 peptide), 
      brevinin-1 (2 peptides), brevinin-2 (2 peptides), and nigrocin-2 (2 peptides) 
      families of antimicrobial peptides. Similar analysis of skin secretions from the 
      Malaysian fire frog Hylarana picturata (Boulenger, 1920) led to the isolation and 
      characterization of peptides belonging to the brevinin-1 (2 peptides), brevinin-2 (5 
      peptides), and temporin (1 peptide) families. The differences in antimicrobial 
      activities of paralogous peptides provide insight into structure-activity 
      relationships, emphasizing the importance of cationicity in determining potency. The 
      substitution Lys11-->Gln in brevinin-1HSa (FLPAVLRVAAKIVPTVFCAISKKC) from O. hosii 
      abolishes growth inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli but has no effect on 
      the high potency (MIC = 8 microg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, the 
      substitution (Gly4-->Asp) in brevinin-2PTb (GFKGAFKNVMFGIAKSAGKSALNALACKIDKSC) from 
      H. picturata reduces activity against both E. coli and S. aureus. Cladistic analysis 
      based upon the amino acid sequences of the brevinin-2 peptides from Asian frogs 
      provides evidence for sister taxon relationships between O. hosii and O. livida and 
      between H. picturata and H. güntheri.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin secretion are a promising source for the 
      development of alternative antibiotics against the urgent antibiotic resistance. 
      Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has been found to persist in both early and 
      late disease course of cystic fibrosis (CF). Japonicin-2LF was isolated from the 
      skin secretion of Fujian Large-headed Frog (Limnonectes fujianensis) via the 
      combination of cDNA cloning and MS/MS sequencing. The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm 
      activities of Japonicin-2LF were evaluated using both reference and clinic isolated 
      strains. The permeability of the cell membrane treated by the peptide was revealed 
      by fluorescent staining. The cytotoxicity was examined by haemolysis, MTT and LDH 
      assays. Wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) infection model was applied to assess 
      the efficacy of Japonicin-2LF against the reference and clinic MRSA isolates in 
      vivo. Japonicin-2LF exhibited potent antimicrobial activity, particularly against 
      Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, killing the bacteria via 
      membrane permeabilisation. Additionally, Japonicin-2LF demonstrated the inhibition 
      and eradication of biofilms, particularly against the biofilm of MRSA by eradicating 
      the biofilm matrix as well as killing all the sessile bacteria. In the in vivo 
      assay, Japonicin-2LF significantly decreased the mortality of MRSA acute infected 
      larvae. In conclusion, it is a novel antimicrobial peptide discovered from the skin 
      secretion of Limnonectes fujianensis, and particularly effective against both 
      planktonic and sessile MRSA. The further in vivo study suggests that Japonicin-2LF 
      could be a potential drug candidate to control the MRSA infection in cystic fibrosis 
      patients.

TI  - A novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Amolops loloensis.

AB  - While conducting experiments to investigate antimicrobial peptides of amphibians 
      living in the Yunnan-Sichuan region of southwest China, a new family of 
      antimicrobial peptides was identified from skin secretions of the rufous-spotted 
      torrent frog, Amolops loloensis. Members of the new peptide family named amolopins 
      are composed of 18 amino acids with a unique sequence, for example, 
      NILSSIVNGINRALSFFG. By BLAST search, amolopins did no show similarity to any known 
      peptides. Among the tested microorganisms, native and synthetic peptides only showed 
      antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC2592 and Bacillus 
      pumilus, no effects on other microorganisms. The CD spectroscopy showed that it 
      adopted a structure of random combined with beta-sheet in water, Tris-HCl or 
      Tris-HCl-SDS. Several cDNAs encoding amolopins were cloned from the skin cDNA 
      library of A. loloensis. The precursors of amolopin are composed of 62 amino acid 
      residues including predicted signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature 
      antimicrobial peptides. The preproregion of amolopin precursor comprises a 
      hydrophobic signal peptide of 22 residues followed by an 18 residue acidic propiece 
      which terminates by a typical prohormone processing signal Lys-Arg. The 
      preproregions of precursors are very similar to other amphibian antimicrobial 
      peptide precursors but the mature amolopins are different from other antimicrobial 
      peptide families. The remarkable similarity of preproregions of precursors that give 
      rise to very different antimicrobial peptides in distantly related frog species 
      suggests that the corresponding genes form a multigene family originating from a 
      common ancestor.

TI  - Temporin-SHf, a new type of phe-rich and hydrophobic ultrashort antimicrobial 
      peptide.
PG  - 16880-92
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.097204 [doi]
AB  - Because issues of cost and bioavailability have hampered the development of 
      gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides to combat infectious diseases, short linear 
      peptides with high microbial cell selectivity have been recently considered as 
      antibiotic substitutes. A new type of short antimicrobial peptide, designated 
      temporin-SHf, was isolated and cloned from the skin of the frog Pelophylax saharica. 
      Temporin-SHf has a highly hydrophobic sequence (FFFLSRIFa) and possesses the highest 
      percentage of Phe residues of any known peptide or protein. Moreover, it is the 
      smallest natural linear antimicrobial peptide found to date, with only eight 
      residues. Despite its small size and hydrophobicity, temporin-SHf has broad-spectrum 
      microbicidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, 
      with no hemolytic activity. CD and NMR spectroscopy combined with restrained 
      molecular dynamics calculations showed that the peptide adopts a well defined 
      non-amphipathic alpha-helical structure from residue 3 to 8, when bound to 
      zwitterionic dodecyl phosphocholine or anionic SDS micelles. Relaxation enhancement 
      caused by paramagnetic probes showed that the peptide adopts nearly parallel 
      orientations to the micelle surface and that the helical structure is stabilized by 
      a compact hydrophobic core on one face that penetrates into the micelle interior. 
      Differential scanning calorimetry on multilamellar vesicles combined with membrane 
      permeabilization assays on bacterial cells indicated that temporin-SHf disrupts the 
      acyl chain packing of anionic lipid bilayers, thereby triggering local cracks and 
      microbial membrane disintegration through a detergent-like effect probably via the 
      carpet mechanism. The short length, compositional simplicity, and broad-spectrum 
      activity of temporin-SHf make it an attractive candidate to develop new antibiotic 
      agents.

TI  - Micelle bound structure and DNA interaction of brevinin-2-related peptide, an 
      antimicrobial peptide derived from frog skin.
PG  - 811-21
LID - 10.1002/psc.2673 [doi]
AB  - Brevinin-2-related peptide (BR-II), a novel antimicrobial peptide isolated from the 
      skin of frog, Rana septentrionalis, shows a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity 
      with low haemolytic activity. It has also been shown to have antiviral activity, 
      specifically to protect cells from infection by HIV-1. To understand the active 
      conformation of the BR-II peptide in membranes, we have investigated the interaction 
      of BR-II with the prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane-mimetic micelles such as 
      sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), respectively. The 
      interactions were studied using fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) 
      spectroscopy. Fluorescence experiments revealed that the N-terminus tryptophan 
      residue of BR-II interacts with the hydrophobic core of the membrane mimicking 
      micelles. The CD results suggest that interactions with membrane-mimetic micelles 
      induce an α-helix conformation in BR-II. We have also determined the solution 
      structures of BR-II in DPC and SDS micelles using NMR spectroscopy. The structural 
      comparison of BR-II in the presence of SDS and DPC micelles showed significant 
      conformational changes in the residues connecting the N-terminus and C-terminus 
      helices. The ability of BR-II to bind DNA was elucidated by agarose gel retardation 
      and fluorescence experiments. The structural differences of BR-II in zwitterionic 
      versus anionic membrane mimics and the DNA binding ability of BR-II collectively 
      contribute to the general understanding of the pharmacological specificity of this 
      peptide towards prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes and provide insights into its 
      overall antimicrobial mechanism.

TI  - Lipid composition regulates the conformation and insertion of the antimicrobial 
      peptide maculatin 1.1.
PG  - 205-11
LID - 10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.07.015 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides interact with cell membranes and their selectivity is 
      contingent on the nature of the constituent lipids. Eukaryotic and bacterial 
      membranes are comprised of different proportions of a range of lipid species with 
      different physical properties. Hence, characterisation of antimicrobial peptides 
      with respect to the magnitude of their interactions with model membranes of 
      different lipid types is needed. Maculatin 1.1 is a short antimicrobial peptide 
      secreted from the skin of several Australian tree-frog species. Circular dichroism 
      spectroscopy (CD) was used to explore the interaction of maculatin 1.1 with a wide 
      range of model membrane systems of different head group and acyl chain 
      characteristics. For neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC), unlike anionic phospholipids, 
      the magnitude of the peptide interactions was dependent on the length and degree of 
      saturation of the constituent acyl chains. Oriented circular dichroism (OCD) data 
      indicated that helical structure was likely promoted by peptide insertion into the 
      hydrophobic core of PC bilayers. The addition of cholesterol (30% mol/mol) tended to 
      decrease the membrane interaction of maculatin 1.1. Anionic lipids locked maculatin 
      1.1 via electrostatic interactions onto the surface of oriented bilayers as seen in 
      OCD spectra. Furthermore, increasing the membrane curvature by reducing the vesicle 
      radii only slightly reduced the proportion of helical structure in all systems by 
      approximately 10%. The peptide-lipid interaction was strongly dependent on both the 
      lipid chain length and head group, which highlights the importance of the lipid 
      composition used to mimic different cell types. This article is part of a Special 
      Issue entitled: Membrane protein structure and function.

AB  - In this study, peptidomics and genomics analyses were used to study antimicrobial 
      peptides from the skin of Hylarana spinulosa. Twenty-nine different antimicrobial 
      peptide precursors were characterized from the skin of H. spinulosa, which produce 
      23 mature antimicrobial peptides belonging to 12 different families. To confirm the 
      actual presence and characteristics of these antimicrobial peptides in the skin 
      tissue extractions from H. spinulosa, we used two distinct methods, one was peptide 
      purification method that combined gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase 
      high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and the other was peptidomics 
      approach based on liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). In the peptidomics approach, incomplete tryptic digestion and gas-phase 
      fractionation (GPF) analysis were used to increase peptidome coverage and 
      reproducibility of peptide ion selection. Multiple species of microorganisms were 
      chosen to test and analyze the antimicrobial activities and spectrum of these 
      antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Preparatory immunity: Seasonality of mucosal skin defences and Batrachochytrium 
      infections in Southern leopard frogs.
PG  - 542-554
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13386 [doi]
AB  - Accurately predicting the impacts of climate change on wildlife health requires a 
      deeper understanding of seasonal rhythms in host-pathogen interactions. The 
      amphibian pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), exhibits seasonality in 
      incidence; however, the role that biological rhythms in host defences play in 
      defining this pattern remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to examine 
      whether host immune and microbiome defences against Bd correspond with infection 
      risk and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Over the course of a 
      year, five populations of Southern leopard frogs (Rana [Lithobates] sphenocephala) 
      in Tennessee, United States, were surveyed for host immunity, microbiome and 
      pathogen dynamics. Frogs were swabbed for pathogen load and skin bacterial diversity 
      and stimulated to release stored antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Secretions were 
      analysed to estimate total hydrophobic peptide concentrations, presence of known 
      AMPs and effectiveness of Bd growth inhibition in vitro. The diversity and 
      proportion of bacterial reads with a 99% match to sequences of isolates known to 
      inhibit Bd growth in vitro were used as an estimate of predicted anti-Bd function of 
      the skin microbiome. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis dynamics followed the expected 
      seasonal fluctuations-peaks in cooler months-which coincided with when host mucosal 
      defences were most potent against Bd. Specifically, the concentration and expression 
      of stored AMPs cycled synchronously with Bd dynamics. Although microbiome changes 
      followed more linear trends over time, the proportion of bacteria that can function 
      to inhibit Bd growth was greatest when risk of Bd infection was highest. We 
      interpret the increase in peptide storage in the fall and the shift to a more 
      anti-Bd microbiome over winter as a preparatory response for subsequent infection 
      risk during the colder periods when AMP synthesis and bacterial growth is slow and 
      pathogen pressure from this cool-adapted fungus is high. Given that a decrease in 
      stored AMP concentrations as temperatures warm in spring likely means greater 
      secretion rates, the subsequent decrease in prevalence suggests seasonality of Bd in 
      this host may be in part regulated by annual immune rhythms, and dominated by the 
      effects of temperature.

TI  - Identification and structure-activity relationship of an antimicrobial peptide of 
      the palustrin-2 family isolated from the skin of the endangered frog Odorrana 
      ishikawae.
PG  - 2052-7
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.08.024 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we identified nine novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the 
      endangered anuran species, Odorrana ishikawae, to assess its innate immune system. 
      In this study an additional antimicrobial peptide was initially isolated based on 
      antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. The new antimicrobial peptide 
      belonging to the palustrin-2 family was named palustrin-2ISb. It consists of 36 
      amino acid residues including 7 amino acids C-terminal to the cyclic heptapeptide 
      Rana box domain. The peptide's primary structure suggests a close relationship with 
      the Chinese odorous frog, Odorrana grahami. The cloned cDNA encoding the precursor 
      protein contained a signal peptide, an N-terminal acidic spacer domain, a Lys-Arg 
      processing site and the C-terminal precursor antimicrobial peptide. It also 
      contained 3 amino acid residues at the C-terminus not found in the mature peptide. 
      Finally, the antimicrobial activities against four microorganisms (E. coli, 
      Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Candida albicans) were 
      investigated using several synthetic peptides. A 29 amino acid truncated form of the 
      peptide, lacking the 7 amino acids C-terminal to the Rana box, possessed greater 
      antimicrobial activities than the native structure.

TI  - Peptidomic Analysis of Skin Secretions of the Caribbean Frogs Leptodactylus 
      insularum and Leptodactylus nesiotus (Leptodactylidae) Identifies an Ocellatin with 
      Broad Spectrum Antimicrobial Activity.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics9100718 [doi]
LID - 718
AB  - Ocellatins are peptides produced in the skins of frogs belonging to the genus 
      Leptodactylus that generally display weak antimicrobial activity against 
      Gram-negative bacteria only. Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
      secretions from Leptodactylus insularum Barbour 1906 and Leptodactylus nesiotus 
      Heyer 1994, collected in the Icacos Peninsula, Trinidad, led to the purification and 
      structural characterization of five ocellatin-related peptides from L. insularum 
      (ocellatin-1I together with its (1-16) fragment, ocellatin-2I and its (1-16) 
      fragment, and ocellatin-3I) and four ocellatins from L. nesiotus (ocellatin-1N, -2N, 
      -3N, and -4N). While ocellatins-1I, -2I, and -1N showed a typically low 
      antimicrobial potency against Gram-negative bacteria, ocellatin-3N 
      (GIFDVLKNLAKGVITSLAS.NH(2)) was active against an antibiotic-resistant strain of 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and reference strains of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium (minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations (MICs) in the range 31.25-62.5 μM), and was the only peptide active 
      against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 31.25 μM) and Enterococcus 
      faecium (MIC = 62.5 μM). The therapeutic potential of ocellatin-3N is limited by its 
      moderate hemolytic activity (LC(50) = 98 μM) against mouse erythrocytes. The peptide 
      represents a template for the design of long-acting, non-toxic, and broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial agents for targeting multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  - A novel antimicrobial peptide, Ranatuerin-2PLx, showing therapeutic potential in 
      inhibiting proliferation of cancer cells.
LID - BSR20180710 [pii]
LID - 10.1042/BSR20180710 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are a promising resource for developing novel antibiotic and 
      even anticancer drugs. Here, a 28-mer polypeptide, Ranatuerin-2PLx (R2PLx), was 
      identified from lyophilised skin secretions. The chemically synthetic replicates 
      exhibited moderate and broadspectrum antimicrobial effect against various 
      microorganisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, minimal 
      inhibitory concentration = 256 µM). In addition, R2PLx was found to inhibit the 
      proliferation of several tumour cells, especially showing more potent effect on 
      prostate cancer cell, PC-3. The early cell apoptosis was observed in 6 h by Annexin 
      V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, as well as the activation of Caspase-3 at 5 µM 
      peptide concentration. R2PLx may therefore be promising for developing new 
      therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Moreover, the artificial deficiency of 
      conserved rana-box loop or net positive charge in C-terminal domain notably reduced 
      the biological activities of the truncated and substituted isoforms, respectively, 
      suggesting for maintaining their biological potency of ranatuerin family requires 
      both cysteine-bridged segment and cationincity within the loop domain in C-terminus.

TI  - Effect of antimicrobial peptides from Australian tree frogs on anionic phospholipid 
      membranes.
PG  - 8557-65
LID - 10.1021/bi800320v [doi]
AB  - Skin secretions of numerous Australian tree frogs contain antimicrobial peptides 
      that form part of the host defense mechanism against bacterial infection. The mode 
      of action of these antibiotics is thought to be lysis of infectious organisms via 
      cell membrane disruption, on the basis of vesicle-encapsulated dye leakage data 
      [Ambroggio et al. (2005) Biophys. J. 89, 1874-1881]. A detailed understanding of the 
      interaction of these peptides with bacterial membranes at a molecular level, 
      however, is critical to their development as novel antibacterial therapeutics. We 
      focus on four of these peptides, aurein 1.2, citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1, and caerin 
      1.1, which exist as random coil in aqueous solution but have alpha-helical secondary 
      structure in membrane mimetic environments. In our earlier solid-state NMR studies, 
      only neutral bilayers of the zwitterionic phospholipid 
      dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were used. Deuterated DMPC ( d 54-DMPC) was 
      used to probe the effect of the peptides on the order of the lipid acyl chains and 
      dynamics of the phospholipid headgroups by deuterium and (31)P NMR, respectively. In 
      this report we demonstrate several important differences when anionic phospholipid 
      is included in model membranes. Peptide-membrane interactions were characterized 
      using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic 
      resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Changes in phospholipid motions and membrane binding 
      information provided additional insight into the action of these antimicrobial 
      peptides. While this set of peptides has significant C- and N-terminal sequence 
      homology, they vary in their mode of membrane interaction. The longer peptides 
      caerin and maculatin exhibited properties that were consistent with transmembrane 
      insertion while citropin and aurein demonstrated membrane disruptive mechanisms. 
      Moreover, aurein was unique with greater perturbation of neutral versus anionic 
      membranes. The results are consistent with a surface interaction for aurein 1.2 and 
      pore formation rather than membrane lysis by the longer peptides.

TI  - Dermaseptins as models for the elucidation of membrane-acting helical amphipathic 
      antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 1184-93
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by a wide variety of organisms are major 
      actors of the host defense systems against invading pathogenic microorganisms. These 
      peptides exhibit a broad spectrum of action against bacteria, yeasts, fungi, 
      protozoa and viruses. It is widely believed that a large part of their antimicrobial 
      effect derives from direct interactions with the lipid membrane surrounding the 
      target cells, causing its permeabilization and cell lysis. However, the exact nature 
      of these interactions is presently unclear. The skin of the amphibians has proved to 
      be a remarkably rich storehouse of AMPs that encompass a wide variety of structural 
      motifs. This natural AMP bank is used in combined approaches, based on biophysical 
      and cellular biology methods, to elucidate how these peptides perturb the membrane 
      and whether such membrane perturbations are related to the antimicrobial activity of 
      these peptides. Here we review our current knowledge about the structure and the 
      mechanism of action of the dermaseptin super-family, α-helical amphipathic AMPs 
      isolated from the skin of frogs of the Phyllomedusa genus. Dermaseptins are 
      genetically related, with a remarkable identity in signal sequences and acidic 
      propieces of their preproforms but have clearly diverged to yield several families 
      of microbicidal cationic peptides that are structurally distinct. Particularly, we 
      focused on the orthologous peptides dermaseptin S and B of which the shortening from 
      the carboxy terminal extremity causes a drastic change in their membrane disruption 
      activity. These peptides could be good models to study the membrane-peptide 
      interactions discussed in this review.

AB  - Increases in the prevalence of multiply resistant microbes have necessitated the 
      search for new molecules with antimicrobial properties. One noteworthy avenue in 
      this search is inspired by the presence of native antimicrobial peptides in the skin 
      of amphibians. Having the second highest diversity of frogs worldwide, Colombian 
      anurans represent an extensive natural reservoir that could be tapped in this 
      search. Among this diversity, species such as Boana pugnax (the Chirique-Flusse 
      Treefrog) are particularly notable, in that they thrive in a diversity of marginal 
      habitats, utilize both aquatic and arboreal habitats, and are members of one of few 
      genera that are known to mount a robust immunological response against the fungus 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has decimated the population of frogs 
      worldwide. To search for molecules with potential antimicrobial activity, we have 
      assembled and annotated a reference transcriptome from the skin of four wild 
      captured B. pugnax from Antioquia, Colombia. Analysis of potential antimicrobial and 
      immunological components was performed using ontology analyses, we identified 
      several antimicrobial chemokines with particularly strong potential for exhibiting 
      broadscale antimicrobial activities, as well as several genes related to rapid 
      alteration of transcriptional (KRAB zinc finger protein) and phosphorylation (MAPK) 
      responses to exogenous stressors. We also found eight families of transmembrane 
      transport proteins, including sodium, potassium and voltage-dependent calcium 
      channels, which will be invaluable in future studies aimed at more precisely 
      defining the diversity and function of cationic antimicrobial peptides with 
      alpha-helical structures. These data highlight the utility of frogs such as Boana 
      pugnax in the search of new antimicrobial molecules. Moreover, the molecular 
      datasets presented here allow us to expand our knowledge of this species and 
      illustrate the importance of preserving the vast potential of Colombian biodiversity 
      for the identification of useful biomolecules.

TI  - Variations in the expressed antimicrobial peptide repertoire of northern leopard 
      frog (Rana pipiens) populations suggest intraspecies differences in resistance to 
      pathogens.
PG  - 1247-57
LID - 10.1016/j.dci.2009.07.004 [doi]
AB  - The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens or Lithobates pipiens) is historically found 
      in most of the provinces of Canada and the northern and southwest states of the 
      United States. In the last 50 years, populations have suffered significant losses, 
      especially in the western regions of the species range. Using a peptidomics 
      approach, we show that the pattern of expressed antimicrobial skin peptides of frogs 
      from three geographically separated populations are distinct, and we report the 
      presence of four peptides (brevinin-1Pg, brevinin-1Pl, ranatuerin-2Pb, and 
      ranatuerin-2Pc) that have not previously been found in skin secretions. The 
      differences in expressed peptides reflect differences in the distribution of alleles 
      for the newly described Brevinin1.1 locus in the three populations. When enriched 
      peptide mixtures were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of the pathogenic 
      amphibian chytrid (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), peptides from Minnesota or 
      Vermont frogs were more effective that peptides from Michigan frogs. Four of the 
      purified peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of two bacterial 
      pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and B. 
      dendrobatidis. Three of the four were effective inhibitors of B. dendrobatidis and 
      S. epidermidis, but none inhibited A. hydrophila. We interpret these differences in 
      expression and activity of antimicrobial peptides as evidence to suggest that each 
      population may have been selected to express a suite of peptides that reflects 
      current and past encounters with skin microbes.

TI  - Molecular strategies in biological evolution of antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 1669-80
AB  - Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides that protect the skin of hylid and ranin frogs 
      against noxious microorganisms are processed from a unique family of precursor 
      polypeptides with a unique pattern of conserved and variable regions opposite to 
      that of conventional secreted peptides. Precursors belonging to this family, 
      designated the preprodermaseptin, have a common N-terminal preproregion that is 
      remarkably well conserved both within and between species, but a hypervariable 
      C-terminal domain corresponding to antimicrobial peptides with very different 
      lengths, sequences, charges and antimicrobial spectra. Each frog species has its own 
      distinct panoply of 10-20 antimicrobial peptides so that the 5000 species of ranids 
      and hylids may produce approximately 100,000 different peptide antibiotics. The 
      strategy that these frogs have evolved to generate this enormous array of peptides 
      includes repeated duplications of a 150 million years old ancestral gene, focal 
      hypermutation of the antimicrobial peptide domain maybe involving a mutagenic DNA 
      polymerase similar to Escherichia coli Pol V, and subsequent actions of positive 
      (diversifying) selection. The hyperdivergence of skin antimicrobial peptides can be 
      viewed as the successful evolution of a multi-drug defense system that provides 
      frogs with maximum protection against rapidly changing microbial biota and minimizes 
      the chance of microorganisms developing resistance to individual peptides. The 
      impressive variations in the expression of frog skin antimicrobial peptides may be 
      exploited for discovering new molecules and structural motifs targeting specific 
      microorganisms for which the therapeutic armamentarium is scarce.

TI  - A plausible mode of action of pseudin-2, an antimicrobial peptide from Pseudis 
      paradoxa.
PG  - 171-82
LID - 10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.08.023 [doi]
AB  - The search for new antibiotic agents is continuous, reflecting the continuous 
      emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Among the new agents are the 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which have the potential to become a leading 
      alternative to conventional antibiotics. Studies for the mechanisms of action of the 
      naturally occurring parent peptides can provide the structural and functional 
      information needed for the development of effective new antibiotic agents. We 
      therefore characterized pseudin-2, an AMP isolated from the skin of the South 
      American paradoxical frog Pseudis paradoxa. We found that pseudin-2 organized to an 
      aggregated state in aqueous solution, but that it dissociated into monomers upon 
      binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), even though it did not neutralize LPS in 
      Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, pseudin-2 assumed an α-helical structure in the 
      presence of biological membranes and formed pores in both bacterial and fungal 
      membranes, through which it entered the cytoplasm and tightly bound to RNA. Thus, 
      the potent antimicrobial activity of pseudin-2 likely results from both the 
      formation of pores capable of collapsing the membrane potential and releasing 
      intracellular materials and its inhibition of macromolecule synthesis through its 
      binding to RNA.

TI  - Peptidomic analysis of antimicrobial peptides in skin secretions of Amolops 
      mantzorum.

LID - 10.2108/zsj.31.143 [doi]
AB  - Amphibian skin secretions contain abundant bioactive peptides that are valuable 
      natural resources for human beings. However, many amphibians are disappearing from 
      the world, making relevant scientific studies even more important. In this study, 24 
      cDNA sequences encoding antimicrobial peptide (AMP) precursors were initially cloned 
      by screening a cDNA library derived from the skin of the Sichuan torrent frog, 
      Amolops mantzorum. Eighteen mature AMPs belonging to 11 different families were 
      deduced from these cDNA clones. Biological function was confirmed in each family of 
      these AMPs. Some of them were purified from the skin secretions, and their molecular 
      structures were determined by Edman degradation. Liquid chromatography in 
      conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based peptidomics was used to 
      further confirm the actual presence and characteristics of mature AMPs in the skin 
      secretions of A. mantzorum. Incomplete tryptic digestion and gas-phase fractionation 
      (GPF) analysis were used to increase the peptidome coverage and reproducibility of 
      peptide ion selection.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptide temporin-1CEa isolated from frog skin secretions inhibits the

AB  - Temporin-1CEa, which is isolated from the skin secretions of the Chinese brown frog 
      Rana chensinensis, exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against 
      gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and antitumor activity. LK2(6) and 
      LK2(6)A(L) are the analogs of temporin-1CEa obtained by replacing amino acids and 
      displayed an improved anticancer activity. In the present study, the 
      anti-inflammatory activity and mechanism of action of temporin-1CEa and its analogs 
      LK2(6) and LK2(6)A(L) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine 
      macrophages were investigated. The results showed that temporin-1CEa and its analogs 
      decreased the production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 
      by inhibiting the protein expression of nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase and the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Isothermal titration 
      calorimetry studies revealed that temporin-1CEa, LK2(6) and LK2(6)A(L) exhibited 
      binding affinities to LPS, an important inflammatory inducer, with Kd values of 0.1, 
      0.03 and 0.06 μM, respectively. Circular dichroism and zeta potential experiments 
      showed that temporin-1CEa and its analogs interacted with LPS by electrostatic 
      binding between the positively charged peptides and negatively charged LPS, 
      resulting in the neutralization of LPS toxicity.

TI  - An antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog 
      Leptodactylus fallax (Anura:Leptodactylidae).
PG  - 173-8
AB  - A 25 amino-acid-residue, C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide with antimicrobial 
      activity, which has been termed fallaxin, was isolated in high yield from the 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus 
      fallax (Anura:Leptodactylidae). The amino acid sequence of the peptide 
      (Gly-Val-Val-Asp-Ile-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asp-Ile-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-Val-Met-Asn-Lys-Leu.NH2) 
      shows structural similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously 
      isolated from the skins of frogs of the genus Rana that are only distantly related 
      to the Leptodactylidae. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that many 
      frog skin antimicrobial peptides are related evolutionarily, having arisen from 
      multiple duplications of an ancestral gene that existed before the radiation of the 
      different families. Fallaxin inhibited the growth of reference strains of 
      Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter 
      cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) but with relatively low potency (MIC> or =20 microM) 
      and was inactive against the Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) and the 
      yeast Candida albicans. The hemolytic activity of fallaxin was very low (HC50>200 
      microM). A second peptide, comprising residues (1-22) of fallaxin, was also isolated 
      from the skin secretions but this component was inactive against the microorganisms 
      tested.

      peptides.
PG  - 1537-50
LID - 10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Skin secretions of hylid frogs show amazing levels of interspecific and 
      intraspecific diversity and are comprised of a cocktail of genetically-related, but 
      markedly diverse antimicrobial peptides that are grouped into a superfamily, termed 
      the dermaseptins, comprising several families: dermaseptins (sensu stricto), 
      phylloseptins, plasticins, dermatoxins, phylloxins, hyposins, caerins, and aureins. 
      Dermaseptin gene superfamily evolution is characterized by repeated gene 
      duplications and focal hypermutations of the mature peptide coding sequence, 
      followed by positive (diversifying) selection. We review here molecular mechanisms 
      leading to these vast combinatorial peptide libraries, and structural and functional 
      properties of antimicrobial peptides of the dermaseptin and plasticin families, as 
      well as those of dermaseptin S9, an amyloidogenic peptide with antimicrobial and 
      chemoattractant activities.

TI  - An antimicrobial peptide with antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 1527-31
AB  - An antimicrobial peptide named odorranain-HP was identified from skin secretions of 
      the diskless odorous frog, Odorrana grahami. It is composed of 23 amino acids with 
      an amino acid sequence of GLLRASSVWGRKYYVDLAGCAKA. By BLAST search, odorranain-HP 
      had similarity to antimicrobial peptide odorranain-W1 but it has a different GLLR 
      N-terminus. The cDNA encoding odorranain-HP was cloned from the cDNA library of the 
      skin of O. grahami. This peptide showed antimicrobial activities against tested 
      microorganisms. Interestingly, odorranain-HP could exert antimicrobial capability 
      against Helicobacter pylori, along with its antimicrobial activities similar to 
      odorranain-W1. This is the first report of naturally occurring peptide with anti-H. 
      pylori activity from amphibian skins.

TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the frog skin peptide, ranatuerin-1 and its 
      [Lys-8]-substituted analog.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - The predicted conformation of ranatuerin-1 (SMLSVLKNLG(10)KVGLGFVACK(20)INK QC), an 
      antimicrobial peptide first isolated from the skin of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, 
      comprises three structural domains: alpha-helix (residues 1-8), beta-sheet (residues 
      11-16) and beta-turn (residues 20-25). Circular dichroism studies confirm 
      significant alpha-helical character in 50% trifluoroethanol. Replacement of Cys-19 
      and Cys-25 by serine resulted only in decreased antimicrobial potency but deletion 
      of either the cyclic heptapeptide region [residues (19-25)] or the N-terminal domain 
      [residues (1-8)] produced inactive analogs. Substitution of the glycine residues in 
      the central domain of the [Ser-19, Ser-25] analog by lysine produced inactive 
      peptides despite increased alpha-helical content and cationicity. The substitution 
      Asn-8-->Lys gave a ranatuerin-1 analog with increased alpha-helicity and cationicity 
      and increased potency against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria 
      and against C. albicans but only a small increase (21%) in hemolytic activity. In 
      contrast, increasing alpha-helicity and hydrophobicity by the substitution 
      Asn-22-->Ala resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in hemolytic activity. Effects on 
      antimicrobial potencies of substitutions of neutral amino acids at positions 4, 18, 
      22, and 24 by lysine were less marked. Strains of pathogenic E. coli from different 
      groups showed varying degrees of sensitivity to ranatuerin-1 (MIC between 5 and 40 
      microM) but [Lys-8] ranatuerin-1 showed increased potency (between 2- and 8-fold; P 
      < 0.01) against all strains. The data demonstrate that [Lys-8] ranatuerin-1 shows 
      potential as a candidate for drug development.

AB  - Host defense peptides of 35 species of Australian frogs from the hylids Cyclorana 
      and Litoria, and the myobatrachids Crinia, Limnodynastes and Uperoleia have been 
      identified. The biological activities of the majority of these peptides have been 
      determined and include hormones, neuropeptides, opioids, immunomodulators, membrane 
      active peptides [including antimicrobial, anticancer, antiviral (enveloped viruses 
      like HIV and Herpes) and antifungal peptides], neuronal nitric oxide synthase 
      inhibitors, pheromones and individual peptides with other specific activities. The 
      host defense peptide skin profile can be diagnostic at both the species and higher 
      taxonomic levels; for example, species of Crinia, Litoria and Uperoleia each produce 
      quite different types of peptides. Species of Cyclorana and Limnodynastes are more 
      difficult to characterize by skin peptides alone: species of both genera produce 
      similar peptides with no apparent activity. The skin peptide profiles of frogs from 
      the genera Crinia, Litoria and Uperoleia may be used together with morphological and 
      cognate methods, to differentiate between sub-species and even different population 
      clusters of the same species. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNAs of precursors (pre-pro 
      peptides) of bioactive peptides from the skin glands of various species of the genus 
      Litoria show that the majority of these peptides originated from a single ancestor 
      gene before the break away of Australia from Gondwana. The exceptions are the 
      caerulein neuropeptides {e.g. caerulein [pEQDY(SO(3)H)TGWMDF(NH(2))]} which have a 
      different origin to that of other Litoria peptides. Disulfide containing peptides 
      from skin glands of species of Crinia show a different evolutionary route to 
      peptides from species of Litoria.

TI  - Modification Strategy of D-leucine Residue Addition on a Novel Peptide from Odorrana 
      schmackeri, with Enhanced Bioactivity and In Vivo Efficacy.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13090611 [doi]
LID - 611
AB  - Brevinins are a well-characterised, frog-skin-derived, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) 
      family, but their applications are limited by high cytotoxicity. In this study, a 
      wild-type des-Leu2 brevinin peptide, named brevinin-1OS (B1OS), was identified from 
      Odorrana schmackeri. To explore the significant role of the leucine residue at the 
      second position, two variants, B1OS-L and B1OS-D-L, were designed by adding 
      L-leucine and D-leucine residues at this site, respectively. The antibacterial and 
      anticancer activities of B1OS-L and B1OS-D-L were around ten times stronger than the 
      parent peptide. The activity of B1OS against the growth of Gram-positive bacteria 
      was markedly enhanced after modification. Moreover, the leucine-modified products 
      exerted in vivo therapeutic potential in an methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA)-infected waxworm model. Notably, the single substitution of D-leucine 
      significantly increased the killing speed on lung cancer cells, where no viable H838 
      cells survived after 2 h of treatment with B1OS-D-L at 10 μM with low cytotoxicity 
      on normal cells. Overall, our study suggested that the conserved leucine residue at 
      the second position from the N-terminus is vital for optimising the dual 
      antibacterial and anticancer activities of B1OS and proposed B1OS-D-L as an 
      appealing therapeutic candidate for development.

TI  - Characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from the skins of frogs of the Rana 
      esculenta complex.
PG  - 955-61
AB  - Rana esculenta is a hybridogenetic hybrid between Rana ridibunda and Rana lessonae 
      and so is best considered as a complex of interbreeding species rather than a 
      discrete single species. In this study, antimicrobial peptides were isolated from a 
      pooled extract of the skins of specimens of the R. esculenta complex collected in 
      the wild. In addition to several peptides belonging to the brevinin and esculentin 
      families that have been previously isolated from skin secretions of a single 
      specimen of R. esculenta, three newly described members of the brevinin-2 family 
      (brevinin-2Ei, brevinin-2Ej, and brevinin-2Ek) and one member of the temporin family 
      (temporin-1Ec) were purified and characterized. In addition, three structurally 
      related peptides with no sequence similarity with antimicrobial peptides isolated 
      from other species of ranid frogs, that potently and selectively inhibit the growth 
      of the Gram-positive bacterium Escherichia coli (minimal inhibitory concentration 
      (MIC<5 microM)), were identified. These peptides show limited amino acid sequence 
      similarity to the homologous exon gene products that encode the N-terminal flanking 
      peptides of preprocaerulein, preproxenopsin, and preprolevitide and so have been 
      termed caerulein precursor-related fragments (CPRF-Ea, CPRF-Eb, and CPRF-Ec). The 
      data suggest that there may be considerable polymorphism among specimens from 
      different populations of the R. esculenta complex. It is proposed that the 
      distribution and amino acid sequences of skin antimicrobial peptides may be useful 
      markers for taxonomic classification of particular sub-populations and for an 
      understanding of phylogenetic interrelationships.

      endangered frog Odorrana ishikawae.
PG  - 670-6
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.12.013 [doi]
AB  - The endangered anuran species, Odorrana ishikawae, is endemic to only two small 
      Japanese Islands, Amami and Okinawa. To assess the innate immune system in this 
      frog, we investigated antimicrobial peptides in the skin using artificially bred 
      animals. Nine novel antimicrobial peptides containing the C-terminal cyclic 
      heptapeptide domain were isolated on the basis of antimicrobial activity against 
      Escherichia coli. The peptides were members of the esculentin-1 (two peptides), 
      esculentin-2 (one peptide), palustrin-2 (one peptide), brevinin-2 (three peptides) 
      and nigrocin-2 (two peptides) antimicrobial peptide families. They were named 
      esculentin-1ISa, esculentin-1ISb, esculentin-2ISa, palustrin-2ISa, brevinin-2ISa, 
      brevinin-2ISb, brevinin-2ISc, nigrocin-2ISa and nigrocin-2ISb. Peptide primary 
      structures suggest a close relationship with the Asian odorous frogs, Odorrana 
      grahami and Odorrana hosii. These antimicrobial peptides possessed a broad-spectrum 
      of growth inhibition against five microorganisms (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, 
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans). Nine 
      different cDNAs encoding the precursor proteins were also cloned and showed that the 
      precursor proteins exhibited a signal peptide, an N-terminal acidic spacer domain, a 
      Lys-Arg processing site and an antimicrobial peptide at the C-terminus.

TI  - The anuran skin peptide bradykinin mediates its own absorption across epithelial 
      barriers of the digestive tract.

AB  - When faced with a potential predator, a wide range of frog species secrete a mixture 
      of peptide toxins from their skin to defend themselves. We have recently shown that 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in a frog's defensive poison enhance the uptake of 
      these peptides across epithelia, thereby speeding up the process of predator 
      intoxication. This study provides evidence that bradykinin, a widespread peptide 
      toxin in anurans (frogs), is capable to pass through epithelial barriers independent 
      of this delivery system. We quantified bradykinin peptides secreted by Bombina 
      orientalis during acute stress, and found that at biologically relevant 
      concentrations, bradykinin passage across model epithelia occurs even in the absence 
      of AMPs. Monitoring of transepithelial electric resistance showed that bradykinin 
      treatment caused a subtle yet prolonged reduction in barrier function, indicating 
      that the peptide itself is capable to increase the permeability of epithelia. Yet, 
      bradykinin does not cause cells to leak lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that it 
      does not damage cell membranes. Moreover, imaging of bradykinin-treated monolayers 
      shows no endocytosis of fluorescent propidium iodide, indicating that the peptide 
      does not perforate cell membranes at smaller scale and therefore is unlikely to 
      cross epithelia via a transcellular passage. Together, these observations suggest 
      that bradykinin, unlike other amphibian neuropeptide toxins, mediates its own 
      passage across mucosal barriers, possibly through a paracellular route. This 
      "self-administering" property, combined with the fact that bradykinins can potently 
      disturb multiple physiological processes, could explain why these peptides are one 
      of the most widespread antipredator peptides in the defensive secretions of frogs.

AB  - In order to investigate the functional and structural properties of cationic 
      alpha-helical peptides in two different membranes, we studied the 20-residue peptide 
      maximin H6 in two membrane-mimetic systems by NMR spectroscopy using partially 
      (15)N-labeled peptide and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Maximin H6, which is 
      found in skin secretions of frogs of the Bombinae family, attacks gram-negative 
      bacteria and acts haemolytically. While the peptide spontaneously folds into similar 
      structures in both neutral dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and negatively charged sodium 
      dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles, its structure is more flexible in SDS as shown by 
      (15)N relaxation measurements. In addition, it is bound closer to the surface of the 
      micelle and rotated by approximately 70 degrees around its helix axis in the 
      negatively charged membrane surrogate compared to the structure in DPC. This might 
      form the basis for peptide-peptide interactions through a GxxxG motif, which could 
      finally lead to membrane disruption and, thus, preferential attack of negatively 
      charged microbial cell walls.

TI  - The first antimicrobial peptide from sea amphibian.
PG  - 678-81
AB  - The crab-eating frog, Rana cancrivora, is one of only a handful of amphibians 
      worldwide that tolerates saline waters. It typically inhabits brackish water of 
      mangrove forests of Southeast Asia. A large amount of antimicrobial peptides 
      belonging to different families have been identified from skins of amphibians 
      inhabiting freshwater. No antimicrobial peptide from sea amphibians has been 
      reported. In this paper, we firstly reported the antimicrobial peptide and its cDNA 
      cloning from skin secretions of the crab-eating frog R. cancrivora. The 
      antimicrobial peptide was named cancrin with an amino acid sequence of 
      GSAQPYKQLHKVVNWDPYG. By BLAST search, cancrin had no significant similarity to any 
      known peptides. The cDNA encoding cancrin was cloned from the cDNA library of the 
      skin of R. cancrivora. The cancrin precursor is composed of 68 amino acid residues 
      including a signal peptide, acidic spacer peptide, which are similar to other 
      antimicrobial peptide precursors from Ranid amphibians and mature cancrin. The 
      overall structure is similar to other amphibian antimicrobial peptide precursors 
      although mature cancrin is different from known peptides. The current results 
      reported a new family of amphibian antimicrobial peptide and the first antimicrobial 
      peptide from sea amphibian.

TI  - A new family of antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of Rana pleuraden.
PG  - 2069-74
AB  - While conducting experiments to investigate antimicrobial peptides of amphibians 
      living in the Yunnan-Guizhou region of southwest China, a new family of 
      antimicrobial peptides was identified from skin secretions of the Yunnan frog, Rana 
      pleuraden. Members of the new peptide family named pleurain-As are composed of 26 
      amino acids with a unique N-terminal sequence (SIIT) and a disulfide-bridged 
      heptapeptide sequence (CRLYNTC). By BLAST search, pleurain-As had no significant 
      similarity to any known peptides. Native and synthetic peptides showed antimicrobial 
      activities against tested microorganisms including Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
      bacteria and fungi. Twenty different cDNAs encoding pleurain-As were cloned from the 
      skin cDNA library of R. pleuraden. The precursors of pleurain-As are composed of 69 
      amino acid residues including predicted signal peptides, acidic propieces, and 
      cationic mature antimicrobial peptides. The preproregion of pleurain-A precursor 
      comprises a hydrophobic signal peptide of 22 residues followed by an 18 residue 
      acidic propiece which terminates by a typical prohormone processing signal Lys-Arg. 
      The preproregions of precursors are very similar to other amphibian antimicrobial 
      peptide precursors but the mature pleurain-As are different from other antimicrobial 
      peptide families. The remarkable similarity of preproregions of precursors that give 
      rise to very different antimicrobial peptides in distantly related frog species 
      suggests that the corresponding genes form a multigene family originating from a 
      common ancestor. Furthermore, pleurain-As could exert antimicrobial capability 
      against Helicobacter pylori. This is the first report of naturally occurring 
      peptides with anti-H. pylori activity from Rana amphibians.

TI  - Design of N-Terminal Derivatives from a Novel Dermaseptin Exhibiting Broad-Spectrum 
      Antimicrobial Activity against Isolates from Cystic Fibrosis Patients.
LID - 10.3390/biom9110646 [doi]
LID - 646
AB  - Dermaseptins are an antimicrobial peptide family widely identified from the skin 
      secretions of phyllomeudusinae frogs. Here, we identify Dermaseptin-PC (DM-PC), from 
      the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa coelestis, and further investigate the properties 
      of this peptide, and a number of rationally designed truncated derivatives. The 
      truncated 19-mer derived from the N-terminus exhibited similar antimicrobial potency 
      when compared to the parent peptide, but the haemolytic effect of this truncated 
      peptide was significantly decreased. Based on previous studies, the charge and 
      hydrophobicity of truncated derivatives can affect the bioactivity of these peptides 
      and thus we designed a 10-mer derivative with an optimised positive charge and a 
      cyclohexylalanine (Cha) at the C-terminus for enhancing the hydrophobicity, 
      DMPC-10A, which retained the antimicrobial activity of the parent peptide. To 
      further investigate the influence of Cha at the C-terminus on activity, it was 
      substituted by alanine (Ala) to generate another derivative, DMPC-10, but this was 
      found to be much less potent. In addition, DM-PC, DMPC-19 and DMPC-10A not only 
      rapidly killed planktonic bacteria isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patient, but 
      also effectively eradicated their biofilm matrices.

TI  - Antimicrobial activities and membrane-active mechanism of CPF-C1 against 
      multidrug-resistant bacteria, a novel antimicrobial peptide derived from skin 
      secretions of the tetraploid frog Xenopus clivii.
PG  - 876-84
LID - 10.1002/psc.2679 [doi]
AB  - Hospital-acquired infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria pose significant 
      challenges for treatment, which necessitate the development of new antibiotics. 
      Antimicrobial peptides are considered potential alternatives to conventional 
      antibiotics. The skin of Anurans (frogs and toads) amphibians is an extraordinarily 
      rich source of antimicrobial peptides. CPF-C1 is a typical cationic antimicrobial 
      peptide that was originally isolated from the tetraploid frog Xenopus clivii. Our 
      results showed that CPF-C1 has potent antimicrobial activity against both sensitive 
      and multidrug-resistant bacteria. It disrupted the outer and inner membranes of 
      bacterial cells. CPF-C1 induced both propidium iodide uptake into the bacterial cell 
      and the leakage of calcein from large liposome vesicles, which suggests a mode of 
      action that involves membrane disturbance. Scanning electron microscopy and 
      transmission electron microscopy verified the morphologic changes of CPF-C1-treated 
      bacterial cells and large liposome vesicles. The membrane-dependent mode of action 
      signifies that the CPF-C1 peptide functions freely and without regard to 
      conventional resistant mechanisms. Additionally, it is difficult for bacteria to 
      develop resistance against CPF-C1 under this action mode. Other studies indicated 
      that CPF-C1 had low cytotoxicity against mammalian cell. In conclusion, considering 
      the increase in multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, CPF-C1 may offer a new 
      strategy that can be considered a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of 
      diseases caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  - Inhibition of frog antimicrobial peptides by extracellular products of the bacterial 
      pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila.
PG  - 384-7
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether the extracellular products (ECPs) from Aeromonas 
      hydrophila, a frog bacterial pathogen that is resistant to skin antimicrobial 
      peptides of three different frog species Xenopus laevis, Litoria aurea and Litoria 
      raniformis, can modulate the activity of these peptides. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECPs 
      were collected from cultures of Klebsiella pneumoniae,a pathogen susceptible to skin 
      antimicrobial peptides of all three tested frog species, and from cultures of Aer. 
      hydrophila. They were tested for protease activity and for inhibition of the 
      antimicrobial activity of natural peptide mixtures and single peptides of all three 
      frog species against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. ECPs from cultures of Aer. 
      hydrophila grown for 16, 24 and 36 h showed protease activity and inhibited the 
      antibacterial activity of all peptides against E. coli ATCC 25922. In contrast, the 
      ECPs from cultures of Kl. pneumoniae neither had protease activity nor inhibited the 
      activity of any peptides. CONCLUSION: The proteolytic ECPs of Aer. hydrophila have 
      the ability to inhibit the skin antimicrobial peptides of frogs. SIGNIFICANCE AND 
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study provide new information on the 
      association of ECPs with the resistance of Aer. hydrophila to frog antimicrobial 
      peptides.

TI  - Evaluation of the skin peptide defenses of the Oregon spotted frog Rana pretiosa 
      against infection by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.
PG  - 797-805

AB  - Population declines due to amphibian chytridiomycosis among selected species of 
      ranid frogs from western North America have been severe, but there is evidence that 
      the Oregon spotted frog, Rana pretiosa Baird and Girard, 1853, displays resistance 
      to the disease. Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were collected from a 
      non-declining population of R. pretiosa that had been exposed to the causative agent 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Peptidomic analysis led to identification and 
      isolation, in pure form, of a total of 18 host-defense peptides that were 
      characterized structurally. Brevinin-1PRa, -1PRb, -1PRc, and -1PRd, esculentin-2PRa 
      and -PRb, ranatuerin-2PRa, -2PRb, -2PRc, and -2PRe, temporin-PRb and -PRc were 
      identified in an earlier study of skin secretions of frogs from a different 
      population of R. pretiosa known to be declining. Ranatuerin-2PRf, -2PRg, -2PRh, 
      temporin-PRd, -PRe, and -PRf were not identified in skin secretions from frogs from 
      the declining population, whereas temporin-PRa and ranatuerin-2PRd, present in skin 
      secretions from the declining population, were not detected in the current study. 
      All purified peptides inhibited the growth of B. dendrobatidis zoospores. Peptides 
      of the brevinin-1 and esculentin-2 families displayed the highest potency (minimum 
      inhibitory concentration = 6.25-12.5 μM). The study provides support for the 
      hypothesis that the multiplicity and diversity of the antimicrobial peptide 
      repertoire in R. pretiosa and the high growth-inhibitory potency of certain peptides 
      against B. dendrobatidis are important in conferring a measure of resistance to 
      fatal chytridiomycosis.

TI  - Two novel families of antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of the Chinese 
      torrent frog, Amolops jingdongensis.
PG  - 328-34
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.07.021 [doi]
AB  - The characterization of new natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can help to solve 
      the serious problem of bacterial resistance to currently used antibiotics. In the 
      current study, we analyzed two families of AMPs from the Chinese torrent frog 
      Amolops jingdongensis with a range of bioactivities. The first family of peptides, 
      named jindongenin-1a, is 24 amino acids in length; a BLAST search of jindongenin-1a 
      revealed no sequence similarity with other AMPs. The second family consists of two 
      peptides containing 29 amino acid residues each. These peptides have high sequence 
      similarity with the AMPs of palustrin-2 and are therefore designated palustrin-2AJ1 
      and palustrin-2AJ2. The cDNA sequences encoding these AMPs have been cloned and the 
      deduced protein sequence of each AMP has been determined by protein sequencing. 
      Sequence and structural analysis showed that each precursor is composed of a 
      putative signal peptide, an N-terminal spacer, a processing site and a 
      disulfide-bridged heptapeptide segment at the C-terminus. We synthesized 
      jindongenin-1a and palustrin-AJ1 to test their antimicrobial, hemolytic, 
      antioxidative and cytotoxic activities. These two peptides showed broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activity to standard and clinically isolated strains of bacteria. In 
      addition, they exhibited weak hemolytic activity to human and rabbit erythrocytes 
      under our experimental conditions. Moreover, these peptides also displayed cytotoxic 
      activity against the K562 and HT29 mammalian cell lines and low anti-oxidant 
      activity. These findings provide helpful insight that will be useful in the design 
      of anti-infective peptide agents.

AB  - The ability of skin antimicrobial peptides of the southern bell frog, Litoria 
      raniformis, to neutralize in vitro the endotoxin, proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS) complex, from two different gram-negative bacterial pathogens, human pathogen 
      Escherichia coli (0111:B4) and frog pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, was 
      investigated. The LPS neutralization activity of the natural mixture of skin 
      antimicrobial peptides was measured using chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate 
      assays. These skin antimicrobial peptides neutralized the LPSs from both pathogens 
      at physiologically relevant concentrations (IC(50)  < 100 µg/mL) showing their 
      potential for non-specific LPS neutralization in vivo in the skin of infected frogs 
      and for development of anti-endotoxin agents.

AB  - Intensive studies have demonstrated that there are many antimicrobial peptides in 
      amphibian skins. Three novel antimicrobial peptides were identified from the skin of 
      the frog, Rana shuchinae. They are named shuchins 3-5. Their sequences were 
      determined as KAYSMPRCKGGFRAVMCWL-NH2, KAYSTPRCKGLFRALMCWL-NH2, and 
      KAYSMPRCKYLFRAVLCWL-NH2 by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry analysis, 
      respectively. They are composed of 19 amino acids (aa) with unique sequences. BLAST 
      search indicated that they showed no similarity to any known peptides or proteins. 
      They are a novel family of antimicrobial peptide. These peptides showed 
      antimicrobial activities against all of tested microorganisms including 
      Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The cDNAs encoding 
      precursors of these peptides were cloned from the skin cDNA library of R. shuchinae. 
      The precursors are composed of 64 amino acid residues including predicted signal 
      peptides, acidic spacer peptides, and mature antimicrobial peptides. The current 
      work identified a novel antimicrobial peptide family.

TI  - Peptide defenses of the Cascades frog Rana cascadae: implications for the 
      evolutionary history of frogs of the Amerana species group.
PG  - 1268-74
AB  - The Cascades frog Rana cascadae belongs to the Amerana (or Rana boylii) group that 
      includes six additional species from western North America (R. aurora, R. boylii, R. 
      draytonii, R. luteiventris, R. muscosa, and R. pretiosa). R. cascadae is 
      particularly susceptible to pathogenic microorganisms in the environment and 
      populations have declined precipitously in parts of its range so that the protection 
      afforded by dermal antimicrobial peptides may be crucial to survival of the species. 
      Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions led to the 
      identification of six peptides with differential cytolytic activities that were 
      present in high abundance. Structural characterization showed that they belonged to 
      the ranatuerin-2 (one peptide), brevinin-1 (one peptide), and temporin (four 
      peptides) families. Ranatuerin-2CSa (GILSSFKGVAKGVAKDLAGKLLETLKCKITGC) and 
      brevinin-1CSa (FLPILAGLAAKIVPKLFCLATKKC) showed broad spectrum antibacterial 
      activity (MIC</=32microM against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) but 
      only brevinin-1CSa was strongly hemolytic against human erythrocytes 
      (LC(50)=5microM). The taxonomy of ranid frogs is currently in a considerable state 
      of flux. The ranatuerin-2 gene is expressed in all members of the Amerana group 
      studied to-date and cladistic analysis based upon a comparison of the amino acid 
      sequences of this peptide indicates that R. cascadae, R. muscosa and R. aurora form 
      a clade that is distinct from one containing R. draytonii, R. boylii, and R. 
      luteiventris. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses based upon 
      comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes.

TI  - Novel Peptides from Skins of Amphibians Showed Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial 
      Activities.
PG  - 419-24
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12672 [doi]
AB  - Peptide agents are often considered as potential biomaterials for developing new 
      drugs that can overcome the rising resistance of pathogenic micro-organisms to 
      classic antibiotic treatments. One key source of peptide agents is amphibian skin, 
      as they provide a great deal of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide (AMP) 
      templates awaiting further exploitation and utilization. In this study, 12 novel 
      AMPs from the skins of 3 ranid frogs, Rana limnocharis, R. exilispinosa, and Amolops 
      afghanus, were identified using a 5' PCR primer. A total of 11 AMPs exhibited 
      similarities with currently known AMP families, including brevinin-1, brevinin-2, 
      esculentin-1, and nigrocin, besides, one AMP, named as Limnochariin, represented a 
      novel AMP family. All 12 AMPs contain a C-terminus cyclic motif and most of them 
      show obvious antimicrobial activities against 18 standard and clinically isolated 
      strains of bacteria, including 4 Gram-positive bacteria, 11 Gram-negative bacteria, 
      and 3 fungus. These findings provide helpful insight that will be useful in the 
      design of anti-infective peptide agents.

TI  - Role of Antimicrobial Peptides in Amphibian Defense Against Trematode Infection.
PG  - 383-91
LID - 10.1007/s10393-016-1102-3 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) contribute to the immune defenses of many vertebrates, 
      including amphibians. As larvae, amphibians are often exposed to the infectious 
      stages of trematode parasites, many of which must penetrate the host's skin, 
      potentially interacting with host AMPs. We tested the effects of the natural AMPs 
      repertoires on both the survival of trematode infectious stages as well as their 
      ability to infect larval amphibians. All five trematode species exhibited decreased 
      survival of cercariae in response to higher concentrations of adult bullfrog AMPs, 
      but no effect when exposed to AMPs from larval bullfrogs. Similarly, the use of 
      norepinephrine to remove AMPs from larval bullfrogs, Pacific chorus frogs, and gray 
      treefrogs had only weak (gray treefrogs) or non-significant (other tested species) 
      effects on infection success by Ribeiroia ondatrae. We nonetheless observed strong 
      differences in parasite infection as a function of both host stage (first- versus 
      second-year bullfrogs) and host species (Pacific chorus frogs versus gray treefrogs) 
      that were apparently unrelated to AMPs. Taken together, our results suggest that 
      AMPs do not play a significant role in defending larval amphibians against trematode 
      cercariae, but that they could be one mechanism helping to prevent infection of 
      post-metamorphic amphibians, particularly for highly aquatic species.

TI  - Characterization of the structure and membrane interaction of the antimicrobial 
      peptides aurein 2.2 and 2.3 from Australian southern bell frogs.
PG  - 2854-64
AB  - The structure and membrane interaction of the antimicrobial peptide aurein 2.2 
      (GLFDIVKKVVGALGSL-CONH(2)), aurein 2.3 (GLFDIVKKVVGAIGSL-CONH(2)), both from Litoria 
      aurea, and a carboxy C-terminal analog of aurein 2.3 (GLFDIVKKVVGAIGSL-COOH) were 
      studied to determine which features of this class of peptides are key to activity. 
      Circular dichroism and solution-state NMR data indicate that all three peptides 
      adopt an alpha-helical structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or lipids such 
      as 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and a 1:1 mixture of DMPC and 
      1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DMPG). Oriented circular 
      dichroism was used to determine the orientation of the peptides in lipid bilayers 
      over a range of concentrations (peptide/lipid molar ratios (P/L) = 1:15-1:120) in 
      DMPC and 1:1 DMPC/DMPG, in the liquid crystalline state. The results demonstrate 
      that in DMPC all three peptides are surface adsorbed over a range of low peptide 
      concentrations but insert into the bilayers at high peptide concentrations. This 
      finding is corroborated by (31)P-solid-state NMR data of the three peptides in DMPC, 
      which shows that at high peptide concentrations the peptides perturb the membrane. 
      Oriented circular dichroism data of the aurein peptides in 1:1 DMPC/DMPG, on the 
      other hand, show that the peptides with amidated C-termini readily insert into the 
      membrane bilayers over the concentration range studied (P/L = 1:15-1:120), whereas 
      the aurein 2.3 peptide with a carboxy C-terminus inserts at a threshold 
      concentration of P/L* between 1:80 and 1:120. Overall, the data presented here 
      suggest that all three peptides studied interact with phosphatidylcholine membranes 
      in a manner which is similar to aurein 1.2 and citropin 1.1, as reported in the 
      literature, with no correlation to the reported activity. On the other hand, both 
      aurein 2.2 and aurein 2.3 behave similarly in 
      phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol (PC/PG) membranes, whereas aurein 2.3-COOH 
      inserts less readily. As this does not correlate with reported activities, minimal 
      inhibitory concentrations of the three peptides against Staphylococcus aureus 
      (strain C622, ATCC 25923) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (strain C621--clinical 
      isolate) were determined. The correlation between structure, membrane interaction, 
      and activity are discussed in light of these results.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line 
      defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe 
      the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel 
      neutral Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of 
      Leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. The amino acid sequence of the 
      peptide purified by RP-HPLC (C(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo 
      sequencing and confirmed by Edman degradation: GLLGGLLGPLLGGGGGGGGGLL. Leptoglycin 
      was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations 
      (MICs) of 8 microM, 50 microM, and 75 microM respectively, but it did not show 
      antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida 
      tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum). No 
      hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microM range concentration. The amino 
      acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) 
      containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of 
      Gly/Leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that this 
      natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.

TI  - Phylloxin, a novel peptide antibiotic of the dermaseptin family of 
      antimicrobial/opioid peptide precursors.
PG  - 370-8
AB  - A novel family of peptide precursors that have very similar N-terminal 
      preprosequences followed by markedly different C-terminal domains has been 
      identified in the skin of hylid frogs belonging to the genus Phyllomedusinae. 
      Biologically active peptides derived from the variable domains include the 
      dermaseptins, 28-34-residue peptides that have a broad-spectrum microbicidal 
      activity, and dermorphin and the deltorphins, D-amino acid containing heptapeptides 
      that are very potent agonists for the micro-opioid and delta-opioid receptors, 
      respectively. This report describes the isolation, synthesis and cloning of 
      phylloxin, a prototypical member of a novel family of antimicrobial peptides derived 
      from the processing of a dermaseptin/dermorphin-like precursor. The structure of 
      phylloxin (GWMSKIASGIGTFLSGIQQ amide) shows no homology to the dermaseptins, but 
      bears some resemblance to the levitide-precursor fragment and the xenopsin-precursor 
      fragment, two antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skin of an evolutionarily 
      distant frog species, Xenopus laevis. Circular dichroism spectra of phylloxin in low 
      polarity medium, which mimics the lipophilicity of the membrane of target 
      microorganisms, indicated 60-70% alpha-helical conformation, and predictions of 
      secondary structure suggested that the peptide can be configured as an amphipathic 
      helix spanning residues 1-19. Phylloxin is an addition to the structurally and 
      functionally diverse peptide families encoded by the rapidly evolving C-terminal 
      domains of the dermorphin/dermaseptin group of precursors.

AB  - Dental caries and periodontitis are common bacterial mouth infections. As a 
      potentially attractive substitute for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial 
      peptides have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. In 
      this study, we tested the efficacy of the peptides from the skin secretions of Rana 
      chensinensis for killing several major cariogenic and periodontic pathogens as well 
      as Candida albicans. L-K6, a temporin-1CEb analog, exhibited high antimicrobial 
      activity against the tested oral pathogens and was able to inhibit Streptococcus 
      mutans biofilm formation and reduce 1-day-old S. mutans biofilms with a minimum 
      biofilm inhibitory concentration and reducing concentration of 3.13 and 6.25 μM, 
      respectively. The results of confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that 
      the peptide significantly reduced cell viability within oral biofilms. Furthermore, 
      as little as 5 μM L-K6 significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and 
      interleukin-1β-induced productions of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α from 
      THP-1 monocytic cells. This anti-inflammatory activity is associated with the 
      binding of L-K6 to LPS and neutralizing LPS-induced proinflammatory responses in 
      THP-1 cells, as well as dissociating LPS aggregates. Our results suggest that L-K6 
      may have potential clinical applications in treating dental caries by killing S. 
      mutans within dental plaque and acting as anti-inflammatory agents in infected 
      tissues.

AB  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the 
      causative agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are two great 
      concerns in the reproductive health of women. Thus, the challenge is to find 
      products with a double activity, on the one hand having antimicrobial/antiviral 
      properties with a role in the reduction of STI, and on the other hand having 
      spermicidal action to be used as a contraceptive. In the absence of an effective 
      microbicide along with the disadvantages of the most commonly used spermicidal 
      contraceptive worldwide, nonoxynol-9, new emphasis has been focused on the 
      development of more potential intravaginal microbicidal agents. Topical microbicides 
      spermicides would ideally provide a female-controlled method of self-protection 
      against HIV as well as preventing pregnancies. Nonoxynol-9, the only recommended 
      microbicide spermicide, damages cervicovaginal epithelium because of its 
      membrane-disruptive properties. Clearly, there is an urgent need to identify new 
      compounds with dual potential microbicidal properties; antimicrobial peptides should 
      be candidates for such investigations. Dermaseptins and magainins are two classes of 
      cationic, amphipathic alpha-helical peptides that have been identified in the skin 
      extracts of frogs Phyllomedusa sauvagei and Xenopus laevis. Regarding their 
      contraceptive activities and their effect against various STI-causing pathogens, we 
      believe that these two peptides are appropriate candidates in the evaluation of 
      newer and safer microbicides spermicides in the future.

TI  - Reflections on a systematic nomenclature for antimicrobial peptides from the skins 
      of frogs of the family Ranidae.
PG  - 1815-9
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.05.029 [doi]
AB  - Frogs belonging to the extensive family Ranidae represent a valuable source of 
      antimicrobial peptides with therapeutic potential but there is currently no 
      consistent system of nomenclature to describe these peptides. Terminology based 
      solely on species name does not reflect the evolutionary relationships existing 
      between peptides encoded by orthologous and paralogous genes. On the basis of 
      limited structural similarity, at least 14 well-established peptide families have 
      been identified (brevinin-1, brevinin-2, esculentin-1, esculentin-2, japonicin-1, 
      japonicin-2, nigrocin-2, palustrin-1, palustrin-2, ranacyclin, ranalexin, 
      ranatuerin-1, ranatuerin-2, temporin). It is proposed that terms that are synonymous 
      with these names should no longer be used. Orthologous peptides from different 
      species may be characterized by the initial letter of that species, set in upper 
      case, with paralogs belonging to the same peptide family being assigned letters set 
      in lower case, e.g. brevinin-1Pa, brevinin-1Pb, etc. When two species begin with the 
      same initial letter, two letters may be used, e.g. P for pipiens and PL for 
      palustris. Species names and assignments to genera may be obtained from Amphibian 
      Species of the World Electronic Database, accessible at 
      http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/index.php. American Museum of Natural 
      History, New York, USA.

      Odorous Frog Skin.
PG  - 160-169

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amphibian skin plays an essential role in protecting organisms from 
      harmful external factors such as UV radiation. How amphibians protect themselves 
      from reactive oxygen species following long-term sun exposure is an important and 
      interesting question. Amphibian skins possess a novel antioxidant system composed of 
      various Antioxidant Peptides (AOPs), which maintain redox homeostasis. However, only 
      a few AOPs have been identified so far. METHODS: Using combinational methods of 
      peptidomics and genomics, we characterized a novel gene-encoded antioxidant peptide 
      (herein named OA-VI12) from Odorrana andersonii skin secretions, which was produced 
      by the post-translational processing of a 59-residue prepropeptide. The amino acid 
      sequence of the OA-V112 was 'VIPFLACRPLGL', with a molecular mass of 1298.6 Da and 
      no observed post-transcriptional modifications. Functional analysis demonstrated 
      that OA-VI12 was capable of scavenging ABTS+, DPPH, NO and decreasing the Fe3+ 
      production. RESULTS: We determined that the C7 amino acid was responsible for ABTS+ 
      and Fe3+ scavenging, activities, the F4, C7, and P9 amino acids were crucial for 
      DPPH scavenging activity, and the P9 amino acid was responsible for NO scavenging 
      activity. Unlike several other amphibian peptides, OA-VI12 did not accelerate wound 
      healing in a full-thickness skin-wound mouse model and did not demonstrate direct 
      microbial killing. Here, we identified and named a novel gene-encoded antioxidant 
      peptide from the skin secretions of an odorous frog species, which may assist in the 
      development of potential antioxidant candidates. CONCLUSION: This study may help 
      improve our understanding of the molecular basis of amphibians' adaptation to 
      environments experiencing long-term UV radiation.

AB  - The growing occurrence of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics has 
      called for the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) with broad antimicrobial spectrum derived from frog skin secretions 
      have been demonstrated to be promising candidates for new antibiotic development. A 
      proven rich source of these compounds are the skin secretions of the frogs in the 
      Phyllomedusa genus. In this study, two novel phylloseptin peptides-phylloseptin-PTa 
      and phylloseptin-PHa-were isolated from the skin secretions of the South American 
      frogs, Phyllomedusa tarsius (P. tarsius) and Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis (P. 
      hypochondrialis) through parallel transcriptomic and peptidomic studies. Replicates 
      obtained by chemical synthesis were structurally analysed and shown to adopt an 
      α-helix configuration in an amphiphilic environment. Both peptides demonstrated 
      antimicrobial activities against planktonic Gram-positive bacteria strains, 
      including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus , biofilms, as well as cytostatic effects on the non-small 
      cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H157, with relatively low haemolysis on horse 
      erythrocytes and low cytotoxicity on the human microvascular endothelial cell line, 
      HMEC-1. The discovery of phylloseptin peptides may further inspire the development 
      of new types of antibiotics.

TI  - Design of potent, non-toxic antimicrobial agents based upon the structure of the 
      frog skin peptide, pseudin-2.
PG  - 85-91
AB  - Pseudin-2, a naturally occurring 24 amino-acid-residue antimicrobial peptide first 
      isolated from the skin of the South American paradoxical frog Pseudis paradoxa, has 
      weak hemolytic and cytolytic activity but also relatively low potency against 
      microorganisms. In a membrane-mimetic environment, the peptide exists in an 
      amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. Analogs of the peptide with increased 
      cationicity and alpha-helicity were chemically synthesized by progressively 
      substituting neutral and acidic amino acid residues on the hydrophilic face of the 
      alpha-helix by lysine. Analogs with up to three L-lysine substitutions showed 
      increased potency against a range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (up to 
      16-fold) whilst retaining low hemolytic activity. The analog [D-Lys3, D-Lys10, 
      D-Lys14]pseudin-2 showed potent activity against gram-negative bacteria (minimum 
      inhibitory concentration, MIC=5 microM against several antibiotic-resistant strains 
      of Escherichia coli) but very low hemolytic activity (HC50>500 microM) and cytolytic 
      activity against L929 fibroblasts (LC50=215 microM). Increasing the number of 
      l-lysines to four and five did not enhance antimicrobial potency further but 
      increased hemolytic activity towards human erythrocytes. Time-kill studies 
      demonstrated that the analog [Lys3, Lys10, Lys14, Lys21]pseudin-2 at a concentration 
      of 1 x MIC was bacteriocidal against E. coli (99.9% cell death after 96 min) but was 
      bacteriostatic against S. aureus. Increasing the hydrophobicity of pseudin-2, while 
      maintaining the amphipathic character of the molecule, by substitution of neutral 
      amino acids on the hydrophobic face of the alpha-helix by L-phenylalanine, had only 
      minor effects on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities.

AB  - Heterogeneity in immune defense effectors can benefit hosts encountering a variety 
      of parasites and pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse set of 
      immune defense effectors in many amphibians, and are secreted from dermal granular 
      glands to protect the skin from infection. Over 50 different skin peptides have been 
      reported from the European water frog hybridogenic complex (Pelophylax esculentus 
      complex), consisting of the hybrid P. esculentus, and the parent species Pelophylax 
      lessonae and Pelophylax ridibundus. In central Europe the hybrid is sympatric with 
      only P. lessonae, while in other areas all three species can co-occur. Amphibian 
      immune defenses are likely under selective pressure from emerging pathogens such as 
      the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). To assess if hybridization 
      affects immune defenses against Bd, we compared skin peptides of the three species 
      in terms of (i) quantity, (ii) activity against Bd, (iii) repertoire, and (iv) 
      stability. Hybrids secreted AMPs at higher quantities and with greater fungicidal 
      activity compared to cohabiting P. lessonae. Compared to P. ridibundus, AMPs from 
      hybrids were of similar quantity but slightly greater antifungal activity. Mass 
      spectrometric analyses (MALDI-TOF) revealed that of all three species P. esculentus 
      has the greatest peptide diversity, a repertoire inclusive of peptides occurring in 
      either one or the other parent species. Measurements of degradation dynamics 
      indicate that peptides remain relatively stable on the skin of all species for over 
      an hour after induction of skin gland secretions. Our data demonstrate that the 
      hybrid has more effective peptide defenses against Bd and a richer peptide 
      repertoire than either parent species. Hybrid advantage in environments hosting 
      virulent pathogens may contribute to disassortative mating preferences, and we 
      suggest that AMP diversity may be analogous to major histocompatibility complex 
      (MHC) heterozygosity by benefiting hosts encountering multiple parasites.

TI  - Selection for antimicrobial peptide diversity in frogs leads to gene duplication and 
      low allelic variation.
PG  - 605-15
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are highly diverse pathogen-killing molecules. In many taxa, 
      their evolution is characterized by positive selection and frequent gene 
      duplication. It has been proposed that genes encoding antimicrobial peptides might 
      be subject to balancing selection and/or an enhanced mutation rate, but these 
      hypotheses have not been well evaluated because allelic variation has rarely been 
      studied at antimicrobial peptide loci. We present an evolutionary analysis of novel 
      antimicrobial peptide genes from leopard frogs, Rana. Our results demonstrate that a 
      single genome contains multiple homologous copies, among which there is an excess of 
      nonsynonymous nucleotide site divergence relative to that expected from synonymous 
      site divergence. Thus, we confirm the trends of recurrent duplication and positive 
      selection. Allelic variation is quite low relative to interspecies divergence, 
      indicating a recent positive selective sweep with no evidence of balancing 
      selection. Repeated gene duplication, rather than a balanced maintenance of 
      divergent allelic variants at individual loci, appears to be how frogs have 
      responded to selection for a diverse suite of antimicrobial peptides. Our data also 
      support a pattern of enhanced synonymous site substitution in the mature peptide 
      region of the gene, but we cannot conclude that this is due to an elevated mutation 
      rate.

AB  - Twenty-two novel cDNAs encoding 22 peptide precursors for 19 mature peptides 
      including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were identified from East Asian frog species 
      Babina daunchina, Babina adenopleura, and Rana omeimontis skin-derived cDNA 
      libraries. Two atypical members of the brevinin-1 family AMPs, named brevinin-1AN1 
      (FLTGVLKLASKIPSVLCAVLKTC) and brevinin-1DN1(FLKGVINLASKIPSMLCAVLKTC), were purified 
      from the skin secretions of B. adenopleura and B. daunchina, respectively. A member 
      of the ranatuerin-2 family AMP named ranatuerin-2DN1 
      (GLFDSITQGLKDTAVKLLDKIKCKLSACPPA) was also purified from the skin secretion of B. 
      daunchina. One AMP named japonicin-2OM1 (FIVPSIFLLKKAFCIALKKNC) was purified from 
      the skin secretion of R. omeimontis. The antimicrobial tests showed that 
      brevinin-1DN1, brevinin-1DN2, brevinin-1AN1, and japonicin-2OM1 possess higher 
      antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) are one of the most common components of the innate 
      immune system that protect multicellular organisms against microbial invasion. The 
      vast majority of AMPs are isolated from the frog skin. Anuran (frogs and toads) skin 
      contains abundant AMPs that can be developed therapeutically. Such peptides are a 
      unique but diverse group of molecules. In general, more than 50% of the amino acid 
      residues form the hydrophobic part of the molecule. Normally, there are no conserved 
      structural motifs responsible for activity, although the vast majority of the AMPs 
      are cationic due to the presence of multiple lysine residues; this cationicity has a 
      close relationship with antibacterial activity. Notably, recent evidence suggests 
      that synthesis of AMPs in frog skin may confer an advantage on a particular species, 
      although they are not essential for survival. Frog skin AMPs exert potent activity 
      against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, protozoa, yeasts, and fungi by permeating and 
      destroying the plasma membrane and inactivating intracellular targets. Importantly, 
      since they do not bind to a specific receptor, AMPs are less likely to induce 
      resistance mechanisms. Currently, the best known amphibian AMPs are esculentins, 
      brevinins, ranacyclins, ranatuerins, nigrocin-2, magainins, dermaseptins, bombinins, 
      temporins, and japonicins-1 and -2, and palustrin-2. This review focuses on these 
      frog skin AMPs and the mechanisms underlying their antimicrobial activity. We hope 
      that this review will provide further information that will facilitate further study 
      of AMPs and cast new light on novel and safer microbicides.

AB  - Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is commonly used to probe the effect of 
      antimicrobial agents on bacterial membranes using model membrane systems. Ideally, 
      considering the complexity of membranes, the interaction of molecules with membranes 
      should be studied in vivo. The interactions of two antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      with intact Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were investigated using deuterium 
      solid-state NMR. Specifically, we studied caerin 1.1 and aurein 1.2 isolated from 
      the skin of Australian tree frogs. The minimal inhibitory concentration value for E. 
      coli and B. subtilis was about 100μg/mL and 30μg/mL, respectively, for both 
      peptides. A protocol to deuterate the membrane phospholipids of non-mutated B. 
      subtilis was established using deuterated palmitic acid. (2)H NMR spectra combined 
      with spectral moment analysis support the interaction of the two AMPs with the 
      hydrophobic core of the bacterial membranes. The presence of peptides decreased the 
      order of the lipid acyl chains for both E. coli and B. subtilis, but at higher 
      peptide concentrations for the Gram(+) bacteria. This may be explained by the 
      presence of other cell wall components, such as the negatively-charged teichoic and 
      lipoteichoic acids in the peptidoglycan, which would interact with the AMPs and 
      decrease their actual concentration on the membrane surface. The mechanism of action 
      of the AMPs thus depends on their local concentration as well as the membrane 
      environment. The differences between the AMPs interaction with E. coli and B. 
      subtilis reveal the importance of studying intact bacteria.

TI  - The Analogs of Temporin-GHa Exhibit a Broader Spectrum of Antimicrobial Activity and 
      a Stronger Antibiofilm Potential against Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24224173 [doi]
LID - 4173
AB  - The abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, 
      which is becoming a serious worldwide problem people have to face. In our previous 
      study, temporin-GHa (GHa) cloned from Hylarana guentheri showed antimicrobial 
      activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In order to improve its therapeutic 
      potential, we used a template-based and a database-assisted design to obtain three 
      derived peptides by replacing the histidine at both ends of GHa with lysine, which 
      exhibited faster and stronger bactericidal activity and a broader spectrum than the 
      parent peptide. GHaK and GHa4K targeted to the bacterial membrane to exert their 
      antibacterial activities at a faster membrane damage rate. The derived peptides 
      inhibited the initial adhesion and the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, 
      and eradicated the mature biofilms, which indicated that the derived peptides 
      effectively penetrated the biofilm and killed bacteria. The therapeutic index (TI) 
      and cell selectivity index (CSI) of the derived peptides increased significantly, 
      which means a broader therapeutic window of the derived peptides. The derived 
      peptides with improved activity and cell selectivity have the potential to be the 
      promising candidates for the treatment of S. aureus infections. Our research also 
      provides new insights into the design and development of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Lividins: novel antimicrobial peptide homologs from the skin secretion of the 
      Chinese Large Odorous frog, Rana (Odorrana) livida. Identification by "shotgun" cDNA 
      cloning and sequence analysis.
PG  - 2118-23
AB  - Odorous frogs of the sub-genus Odorrana are of oriental distribution, and are so 
      called due to the foul smell of their defensive skin secretions released from 
      specialized skin glands following stress or predator attack. Here we report the 
      application of a "shotgun" skin secretion cDNA library cloning technique which can 
      rapidly expedite identification of secretion bioactive peptides. From a library 
      constructed from the skin secretion of the Large Chinese Odorous frog, Rana 
      (Odorrana) livida, we have identified four novel peptides whose primary structures 
      were deduced initially from cloned precursors. Subsequently, mature peptides were 
      located in and structurally characterized from reverse phase HPLC fractions of skin 
      secretion. Named lividins 1-4, these were found to be structural homologs of known 
      antimicrobial peptide families from Rana frogs. Rapid identification of novel 
      peptides can thus be rapidly achieved using this non-invasive, non-destructive 
      technology and the extensive similarities revealed between antimicrobial peptide 
      precursor organization and nucleic acid sequences would lend support to the 
      hypothesis that they have a common ancestral origin.

AB  - We have cloned, synthesized, and characterized 11 novel antimicrobial peptides from 
      a skin derived cDNA library of the Chungan torrent frog, Amolops chunganensis. Seven 
      of the 11 antimicrobial peptides were present in authentic A. chunganensis skin 
      secretions. Sequence analysis indicated that the 11 peptides belonged to the 
      temporin, esculentin-2, palustrin-2, brevinin-1, and brevinin-2 families. The 
      peptides displayed potent antimicrobial activities against several strains of 
      microorganisms. One peptide, brevinin-1CG5, demonstrated antimicrobial activity 
      against all tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, and showed 
      high antimicrobial potency (MIC=0.6 μM) against Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus 
      rhodochrous. Some peptides also demonstrated weak hemolytic activity against human 
      erythrocytes in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of 
      brevinin-1, brevinin-2, and esculentin-2 peptides from family Ranidae confirmed that 
      the current taxonomic status of A. chunganensis is correct.

TI  - Inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects of two antimicrobial peptides moronecidin

PG  - e3255
LID - 10.1002/psc.3255 [doi]
AB  - Proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is one of the main pathogenetic 
      mechanisms of acne. Antimicrobial peptides with low-drug resistance and nonresidual 
      are potential anti-acne agents. In this study, two antimicrobial peptides named 
      temporin-1Dra and moronecidin were synthesized and tested their antimicrobial 
      activity against P. acnes in vitro and in vivo. These two peptides inhibited the 
      growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and P. acnes. 
      The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of temporin-1Dra and moronecidin to P. 
      acnes were 30 and 10 μM, respectively. Both peptides exhibited strong resistance to 
      heat and pH, but no obvious cytotoxicity to HaCaT cells. They also displayed 
      persistent antimicrobial activities in the microbial challenge test. In the P. 
      acnes-induced inflammation mouse model, moronecidin significantly decreased the ear 
      swelling thickness in a concentration-dependent manner. At the 14th day after 
      injection, 20 μg/day moronecidin reduced the ear swelling thickness to 46.15 ± 5.23% 
      compared with the normal cream group. Tissue staining showed that moronecidin 
      effectively reduced abscess and thickness of the dermis layer. Our results indicate 
      that the antimicrobial peptide moronecidin could be developed as a potential natural 
      anti-acne agent in the cosmetics or pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - The skins of amphibians secrete small antimicrobial peptides that fight infection 
      and are being explored as potential alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In 
      this study we combined mass spectrometry with cDNA sequencing to examine 
      antimicrobial peptides in skin secretions from the Chinese frog Rana dybowskii. 
      Thirteen peptides having precursor sequences that resemble known antimicrobial 
      peptides from this genus were identified, ten of which were members of previously 
      described peptide families based on their primary structures; i.e., brevinin-1, 
      Japonicin-1, brevinin-2 and temporin. The other three peptides from R. dybowskii, 
      which were named dybowskin-1CDYa, dybowskin-2 CDYa and dybowskin-2CDYb, had 
      different amino acid compositions and little sequence similarity to known 
      antimicrobial peptides. The carboxyl terminus of dybowskin-1CDY lacked amidation and 
      is therefore clearly distinct from temporin peptides, whereas dybowskin-2CDYa and 
      dybowskin-2CDYb consisted of 18 amino acids and were rich in Arg residues. 
      Chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to mature dybowskin-1CDYa and 
      dybowskin-2CDYa had strong antimicrobial activity and caused little hemolysis of 
      human erythrocytes, suggesting they may serve as interesting templates for the 
      development of novel antibiotics.

TI  - Novel antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skin secretions of Hainan odorous 
      frog, Odorrana hainanensis.
PG  - 285-90
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2012.03.007 [doi]
AB  - Long time geographical isolation of Hainan Island from the China continent has 
      resulted in appearance of many novel frog species. As one of them, Hainan odorous 
      frog, Odorrana hainanensis possesses some special antimicrobial peptides distinct 
      from those found in other Odorrana. In this study, three antimicrobial peptides have 
      been purified and characterized from the skin secretion of O. hainanensis. With the 
      similarity to the temporin family, two peptides are characterized by amidated 
      C-terminals, so they are named as temporin-HN1 (AILTTLANWARKFL-NH(2)) and 
      temporin-HN2 (NILNTIINLAKKIL-NH(2)). The third antimicrobial peptide belongs to the 
      brevinin-1 family which is widely distributed in Eurasian ranids, and thus, it is 
      named as brevinin-1HN1 (FLPLIASLAANFVPKIFCKITKKC). Furthermore, after sequencing 68 
      clones, eight cDNAs encoding antimicrobial peptide precursors were cloned from the 
      skin-derived cDNA library of O. hainanensis. These eight cDNAs can encode seven 
      mature antimicrobial peptides including the above three, as well as brevinin-1V, 
      brevinin-2HS2, odorranain-A6, and odorranain-B1. Twelve different species of 
      microorganisms were chosen, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative and fungi, to 
      test the antimicrobial activities of temporin-HN1, temporin-HN2, brevinin-1HN1, 
      brevinin-1V, and brevinin-2HS2. The result shows that, in addition to their 
      activities against Gram-positive bacteria, temporin-HN1 and temporin-HN2 also 
      possess activities against some Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. However, the two 
      antimicrobial peptides, brevinin-1HN1 and brevinin-1V of the brevinin-1 family have 
      stronger antimicrobial activities than temporin-HN1 and temporin-HN2 of the temporin 
      family. Brevinin-1HN1 possesses activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), 
      Rhodococcus rhodochrous X15, and Slime mould 090223 at the concentration of 1.2 μM.

TI  - ²H solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of whole Escherichia coli 
      interacting with antimicrobial peptide MSI-78.
PG  - 118-25
LID - 10.1021/bi201569t [doi]
AB  - A key aspect of the activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is their interaction 
      with membranes. Efforts to elucidate their detailed mechanisms have focused on 
      applying biophysical methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to AMPs in 
      model lipid systems. However, these highly simplified systems fail to capture many 
      of the features of the much more complex cell envelopes with which AMPs interact in 
      vivo. To address this issue, we have designed a procedure to incorporate high levels 
      of (2)H NMR labels specifically into the cell membrane of Escherichia coli and used 
      this approach to study the interactions between the AMP MSI-78 and the membranes of 
      intact bacteria. The (2)H NMR spectra of these membrane-deuterated bacteria can be 
      reproduced in the absence and presence of MSI-78. Because the (2)H NMR data provide 
      a quantitative measure of lipid disorder, they directly report on the lipid bilayer 
      disruption central to the function of AMPs, in the context of intact bacteria. 
      Addition of MSI-78 to the bacteria leads to decreases in the order of the lipid acyl 
      chains. The molar peptide:lipid ratios required to observe the effects of MSI-78 on 
      acyl chain order are approximately 30 times greater than the ratios needed to 
      observe effects in model lipid systems and approximately 100 times less than the 
      ratios required to observe inhibition of cell growth in biological assays. The 
      observations thus suggest that MSI-78 disrupts the bilayer even at sublethal AMP 
      levels and that a large fraction of the peptide does not actually reach the inner 
      membrane.

PG  - 135-8
AB  - An extract of skin taken from specimens of the freeze-tolerant wood frog, Rana 
      sylvatica, that were collected from cold (<7 degrees C) ponds and maintained at 5 
      degrees C lacked detectable antimicrobial activity. In contrast, an extract of skin 
      taken from specimens maintained at 30 degrees C for 3 weeks under laboratory 
      conditions contained a high concentration (approximately 4 nmol/g) of a single 
      antimicrobial peptide of the brevinin-1 family (FLPVVAGLAAKVLPSIICAVTKKC). The 
      peptide inhibited growth of Escherichia coli (minimum inhibitory concentration 45 
      microM) and Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration 7 microM). The 
      data suggest that synthesis of the peptide is induced when the animal is in an 
      environment that promotes the growth of microorganisms consistent with a role in the 
      animal's defense strategy.

PG  - 358-65

AB  - The increasing resistance of bacteria and fungi to the available 
      antibiotic/antimycotic drugs urges for a search for new anti-infective compounds 
      with new modes of action. In line of this, natural CAMPs represent promising and 
      attractive candidates. Special attention has been devoted to frog-skin temporins, 
      because of their short size (10-14 residues long) and their unique features. In 
      particular, temporin-1Ta has the following properties: (i) it is mainly active on 
      Gram-positive bacteria; (ii) it can synergize, when combined with temporin-1Tl, in 
      inhibiting both gram-negative bacterial growth and the toxic effect of LPS; (iii) it 
      preserves biological activity in the presence of serum; and (iv) it is practically 
      not hemolytic. Rational design of CAMPs represents a straightforward approach to 
      obtain a peptide with a better therapeutic index. Here, we used alanine scanning 
      analogs to elucidate the contribution of the side chains of each amino acid residue 
      to the peptide's antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. Beside providing insight into 
      the biophysical attributes and the critical positions within the peptide sequence, 
      which govern the antimicrobial/hemolytic activity of this temporin isoform, our 
      studies assist in optimizing the design of temporin-based lead structures for the 
      production of new anti-infective agents.

PG  - 101-8
AB  - Amphibian skin antimicrobial peptides exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial 
      activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterium and cytotoxic activity 
      responsible for inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. In this present study, six 
      cDNAs encoding antimicrobial peptide precursors were cloned from the skin of Chinese 
      brown frog, Rana chensinensis by RT-PCR and 3'-RACE procedure and identified as 
      preprotemporin-1CEa, preprotemporin-1CEb, preprotemporin-1CEc, preprobrevinin-1CEa, 
      preprobrevinin-1CEb, and preprochensinin-1, respectively. The nucleotide sequences 
      of cDNA encoding 59-65 amino acid composed of 289-315 bp. Preprotemporin-1CEa, 
      preprotemporin-1CEb and preprotemporin-1CEc are members of temporin family, which 
      usually are short, hydrophobic, and C-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial 
      peptides. Preprobrevinin-1CEa and preprobrevinin-1CEb were identified as the members 
      of the brevinin-1 family of antimicrobial peptides since both peptides contain "RANA 
      box" that it's responsible for forming Cys-bridged cyclic heptapeptides at the 
      C-terminal region of peptide. The nucleotide acid sequence and the deduced amino 
      acid Sequence of preprochensinin-1 were not found to be identity with any known 
      amphibian skin defensive peptides, so, preprochensinin-1 was identified as a novel 
      peptide precursor. Four of bioactive peptides: temporin-1CEa, temporin-1CEb, 
      brevinin-1CEa and chensinin-1 were synthesized to investigate their antimicrobial, 
      anticancer and haemolysis activities. The results showed that all of the synthesized 
      antimicrobial peptides in this study inhibited the growth of the Gram-positive 
      bacterium, and exhibited the anticancer activity against the growth of MCF-7 cells 
      and HeLa cells. Analysis of the R. chensinensis bioactive peptides and their gene 
      expression will be beneficial for preservation of this species.

AB  - Amphibian skin is a mucosal surface in direct and continuous contact with a 
      microbially diverse and laden aquatic and/or terrestrial environment. As such, frog 
      skin is an important innate immune organ and first line of defence against pathogens 
      in the environment. Critical to the innate immune functions of frog skin are the 
      maintenance of physical, chemical, cellular, and microbiological barriers and the 
      complex network of interactions that occur across all the barriers. Despite the 
      global decline in amphibian populations, largely as a result of emerging infectious 
      diseases, we understand little regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that 
      underlie the innate immune function of amphibian skin and defence against pathogens. 
      In this review, we discuss the structure, cell composition and cellular junctions 
      that contribute to the skin physical barrier, the antimicrobial peptide arsenal 
      that, in part, comprises the chemical barrier, the pattern recognition receptors 
      involved in recognizing pathogens and initiating innate immune responses in the 
      skin, and the contribution of commensal microbes on the skin to pathogen defence. We 
      briefly discuss the influence of environmental abiotic factors (natural and 
      anthropogenic) and pathogens on the immunocompetency of frog skin defences. Although 
      some aspects of frog innate immunity, such as antimicrobial peptides are 
      well-studied; other components and how they contribute to the skin innate immune 
      barrier, are lacking. Elucidating the complex network of interactions occurring at 
      the interface of the frog's external and internal environments will yield insight 
      into the crucial role amphibian skin plays in host defence and the environmental 
      factors leading to compromised barrier integrity, disease, and host mortality.

TI  - Characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the endangered 
      frog Odorrana ishikawae by shotgun cDNA cloning.
PG  - 673-7
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.08.023 [doi]
AB  - We recently reported the primary structures, antimicrobial activities and cDNA 
      precursors of nine novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the endangered 
      anuran species, Odorranaishikawae. Their cDNA clones revealed a highly conserved 
      approximately 60 bp region upstream of the start codon. This conserved region was 
      used in the "shotgun" cDNA cloning method to reveal additional cDNAs encoding novel 
      antimicrobial peptides of O.ishikawae. After sequencing 344 clones, we identified 
      novel 13 cDNAs encoding dermal peptides in addition to the previously identified 
      nine antimicrobial peptides. These 13 unique cDNAs encoded precursor proteins each 
      containing a signal peptide, an N-terminal acidic spacer domain, a Lys-Arg/Lys 
      processing site and a dermal peptide at the C-terminus. The dermal peptides were 
      members of the palustrin-2 (two peptides; termed palustrin-2ISc and palustrin-2ISd), 
      nigrocin-2 (one peptide; nigrocin-2ISc), brevinin-1 (one peptide; brevinin-1ISa), 
      odorranain-M (one peptide; odorranain-MISa) and entirely novel peptides (eight 
      peptides; ishikawain-1-8). Although palustrin-2ISd and odorranain-MISa had few 
      antimicrobial activities, palustrin-2ISc and nigrocin-2ISc possessed a 
      broad-spectrum of growth inhibition against bacteria. Brevinin-1ISa had the most 
      potent antimicrobial activities against the Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus 
      but not the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichiacoli. However, eight novel peptides 
      showed no growth inhibition against these microorganisms.

TI  - Structure-activity relationships of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Rana 
      esculenta inhabiting in Korea.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - The anuran (frogs and toads) skin is a rich source of antimicrobial peptides that 
      can be developed therapeutically. We searched the skin secretions of Korean Rana 
      esculenta for antimicrobial peptides, and isolated two cationic peptides with 
      antimicrobial activity and little hemolytic activity: a 46-residue peptide of the 
      esculentin-1 family and a 24-residue peptide of the brevinin-1 family. Their 
      sequences showed some differences from the esculentins-1 and brevinins-1 of European 
      Rana esculenta, indicating that sequence diversification of anuran skin 
      antimicrobial peptides can arise from differences in habitat as well as from species 
      differences. The 46-residue peptide named esculentin-1c had broad antimicrobial 
      activity, while the 24-residue peptide named brevinin-1Ed exhibited limited 
      activity. The solution structure of brevinin-1Ed was in good agreement with that of 
      other brevinin-1-like peptides, with an amphipathic alpha-helix spanning residues 
      3-20, stabilized in membrane-mimetic environments. The weak bioactivity of 
      brevinin-1Ed was attributable to the unusual presence of an anionic amino acid in 
      the middle of the helical hydrophilic face. This report contributes to world-wide 
      investigations of the structure-activity relationships and evolutional 
      diversification of anuran-skin antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Skin secretions of Rana saharica frogs reveal antimicrobial peptides esculentins-1 
      and -1B and brevinins-1E and -2EC with novel insulin releasing activity.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Skin secretions of Rana saharica were evaluated for the isolation and 
      characterisation of novel insulinotropic peptides. Crude secretions obtained from 
      young adult frogs by mild electrical stimulation of the dorsal skin surface were 
      purified by reverse phase HPLC yielding 80 fractions. In acute 20-min incubations 
      with glucose responsive BRIN-BD11 cells, fractions 36-43, 46-54 and 57-63 
      significantly stimulated insulin release by 2- to 8-fold compared with 5.6 mM 
      glucose alone. Pooled fractions in the latter two bands were rechromatographed to 
      reveal 9 homogenous peaks, which elicited significant 1.3- to 3.5-fold increases in 
      insulin release (P < 0.05). Structural analysis of the most potent non-toxic 
      peptides was performed by mass spectrometry and automated Edman degradation. This 
      revealed four major insulin-releasing peaks with molecular masses of 2,676.9 Da, 
      3,519.3 Da, 4,920.4 Da and 4,801.2 Da respectively. These peptides were found to be 
      identical to brevinin-1E, brevinin-2EC, esculentin-1 and esculentin-1B, which belong 
      to the group of antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of various Rana 
      frog species. Preliminary studies on the mechanism underlying the insulinotropic 
      actions of esculentins-1 and -1B suggested possible involvement of both cyclic 
      AMP-protein kinase A and -C-dependent G-protein sensitive pathways. These data 
      indicate that the skin secretions of Rana saharica frogs contain bioactive molecules 
      with significant insulin-releasing activity. Relatives of the brevinin/esculentin 
      peptide family merit further investigation as novel insulin secretagogues.

TI  - Identification and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from skin of Amolops 
      ricketti (Anura: Ranidae).
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.10.030 [doi]
AB  - As one of large amphibian group, there are a total of 45 species of Amolops in the 
      world. However, the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) existing in this genus has not 
      been extensively studied. In this study, cDNAs encoding five novel AMP precursors 
      were cloned by screening the skin-derived cDNA library of Amolops ricketti, a frog 
      species that exists in southern and western parts of China. Protein sequence 
      analysis led to the identification of five deduced peptides, three belonging to the 
      brevinin-1 family and two belonging to the brevinin-2 family of amphibian AMPs. 
      Thus, they were named as brevinin-1RTa (FLPLLAGVVANFLPQIICKIARKC), brevinin-1RTb 
      (FLGSLLGLVGKVVPTLFCKISKKC), brevinin-1RTc (FLGSLLGLVGKIVPTLICKISKKC), brevinin-2RTa 
      (GLMSTLKDFGKTAAKEIAQSLLSTASCKLAKTC), and brevinin-2RTb 
      (GILDTLKEFGKTAAKGIAQSLLSTASCKLAKTC), respectively. The purification of 
      brevinin-1RTa, brevinin-1RTb, and brevinin-2RTb was carried out by RP-HPLC, and 
      confirmed by the LC-MS/MS-based proteomics approach. All of the peptides displayed 
      different antimicrobial potency against a variety of microorganisms. In addition, 
      brevinin-2RTa and brevinin-2RTb were found to have relatively low hemolytic activity 
      (>400μg/ml) against mammalian red blood cells in vitro, which could potentially be 
      as candidates for developing novel anti-infection agents.

TI  - Induction of antimicrobial peptides from Rana dybowskii under Rana grylio virus 
      stress, and bioactivity analysis.

AB  - The skin glands of Ranidae are a rich source of antimicrobial peptides. In this 
      study, the genomic RNA of Rana dybowskii was extracted from its skin while under 
      Rana grylio virus stress. Five new cDNA sequences encoding 5 mature peptides, 
      Ranatuerin-2YJ (GLMDIFKVAVNKLLAAGMNKPRCKAAHC), Dybowskin-YJb (IIPLPLGYFAKKP), 
      Dybowskin-YJa (IIPLPLGYFAKKKKKKDPVPLDQ), Temperin-YJa (VLPLLETCSMTCWENNQTFGK), and 
      Temperin-YJb (VLPLVGNLLNDLLGK), were obtained by reverse transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction with a pair of degenerate primers designed according to the conserved 
      terminal sequences of cDNA encoding antimicrobial peptide precursors of genus Rana. 
      The antimicrobial activities of the peptides were analyzed, and the results 
      demonstrated that all these peptides showed a significant anti-Rana grylio virus 
      activity, and the virus was gradually cleared with the increase in gene expression. 
      Among the 5 peptides obtained in this work, Ranatuerin-2YJ also showed a 
      broad-spectrum anti-Gram-positive bacteria and anti-Gram-negative bacteria activity 
      with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 22.5 µg/mL and 7.64% hemolysis activity, 
      both of which were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of the other peptides. 
      Moreover, Ranatuerin-2YJ was widely distributed in the skin, liver, spleen, and 
      blood of R. dybowskii, while the other 4 peptides could only be cloned from the 
      skin, indicating that the Ranatuerin-2YJ in vivo plays an important role in the 
      protection against pathogen invasion.

TI  - Novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Rana shuchinae.
PG  - 1674-7
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.05.014 [doi]
AB  - So far numerous antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from amphibians. In 
      this work, a new family of antimicrobial peptides, named shuchin, was purified and 
      characterized from skin secretions of the frog, Rana shuchinae that lives in 
      freezing mountains. Totally two members of shuchin (shuchin 1 and 2) were identified 
      with the amino acid sequence of NALSMPRNKCNRALMCFG and NALSSPRNKCDRASSCFG, 
      respectively. cDNAs encoding shuchins were cloned from the skin cDNA library of R. 
      shuchinae. The precursors of shuchin are composed of 62 amino acid residues 
      including the conserved signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature antimicrobial 
      peptides. Synthetic shuchins showed strong and broad antimicrobial activities 
      against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus; 
      MICs<12.5 microg/ml), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus 
      dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; most MICs from 3.1 to 12.5 microg/ml), and 
      yeast (Candida albicans; MICs of 6.25 microg/ml), but no hemolytic activity under 
      the effective concentration, thereby provide more leading templates for designing 
      novel anti-infection agents.

TI  - Coqui frogs persist with the deadly chytrid fungus despite a lack of defensive 
      antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 81-3
LID - 10.3354/dao02823 [doi]
AB  - The amphibian skin fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) occurs widely in 
      Puerto Rico and is thought to be responsible for the apparent extinction of 3 
      species of endemic frogs in the genus Eleutherodactylus, known as coquis. To examine 
      immune defenses which may protect surviving species, we induced secretion of skin 
      peptides from adult common coqui frogs E. coqui collected from upland forests at El 
      Yunque. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) 
      mass spectrometry, we were unable to detect peptide signals suggestive of 
      antimicrobial peptides, and enriched peptides showed no capacity to inhibit growth 
      of Bd. Thus, it appears that E. coqui depend on other skin defenses to survive in 
      the presence of this deadly fungus.

TI  - Membrane interaction and antibacterial properties of chensinin-1, an antimicrobial 
      peptide with atypical structural features from the skin of Rana chensinensis.
PG  - 1551-60
LID - 10.1007/s00253-012-4148-3 [doi]
AB  - Many antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin have been purified and structurally 
      characterized and may be developed as therapeutic agents. Here we describe the 
      antibacterial properties and membrane interaction of chensinin-1, a cationic 
      arginine/histidine-rich antimicrobial peptide, from the skin secretions of Rana 
      chensinensis. The amino acid composition, sequence, and atypical structure of 
      chensinin-1 differ from other known antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin. 
      Chensinin-1 exhibited selective antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive 
      bacteria, was inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, and had no hemolytic activity 
      on human erythrocytes. The CD spectra for chensinin-1 indicated that the peptide 
      adopted an aperiodic structure in water and a conformational structure with 20 % 
      β-strands, 8 % α-helices, and the remaining majority of random coils in the 
      trifluoroethanol or SDS solutions. Time-kill kinetics against Gram-positive Bacillus 
      cereus demonstrated that chensinin-1 was rapidly bactericidal at 2× MIC and PAE was 
      found to be >5 h. Chensinin-1 caused rapid and large dye leakage from negatively 
      charged model vesicles. Furthermore, membrane permeation assays on intact B. cereus 
      indicated that chensinin-1 induced membrane depolarization in less than 1 min and 
      followed to damage the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane and resulted in efflux 
      of molecules from cytoplasma. Hence, the primary target of chensinin-1 action was 
      the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Chensinin-1 was unable to overcome bacterial 
      resistance imposed by the lipopolysaccharide leaflet, the major constituent of the 
      outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide induced oligomerization 
      of chensinin-1, thus preventing its translocation across the outer membrane.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the New World frogs Lithobates 
      capito and Lithobates warszewitschii (Ranidae).
PG  - 1775-81
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.07.011 [doi]
AB  - Taxonomic revisions within the anuran family Ranidae have established the genus 
      Lithobates that currently comprises 49 species of frogs from the New World. 
      Peptidomic analysis, using reversed-phase HPLC with on-line detection by 
      electrospray mass spectrometry, has led to the identification of multiple 
      antimicrobial peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the North 
      American frog Lithobates capito and the Central American frog Lithobates 
      warszewitschii. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that the L. 
      capito secretions contained brevinin-1 (1), esculentin-1 (1), esculentin-2 (1), 
      ranatuerin-2 (3), and temporin (2) peptides. L. warszewitschii secretions contained 
      brevinin-1 (1), esculentin-2 (1), ranatuerin-2 (2), and temporin (1) peptides. 
      Values in parentheses indicate number of peptides in each family. Temporin-CPa from 
      L. capito, with the atypical structure IPPFIKKVLTTVF.NH(2), also showed atypical 
      growth-inhibitory activity having greater potency against Escherichia coli (MIC=25 
      microM) and Candida albicans (MIC=25 microM) than against Staphylococcus aureus 
      (MIC=50 microM). Phylogenetic analysis based upon the amino acid sequences of 37 
      ranatuerin-2 peptides from 17 species belonging to the genus Lithobates provides 
      support for currently accepted taxonomic relationships. L. capito is sister-group to 
      Lithobates sevosus in a clade that also contains Lithobates areolatus, and 
      Lithobates palustris. L. warszewitschii is most closely related to the Central 
      American species Lithobates tarahumarae and Lithobates vaillanti.

TI  - Folded structure and insertion depth of the frog-skin antimicrobial Peptide

      micelles.
PG  - 2410-7
LID - 10.1021/np5004406 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are effectors of the innate immunity of most 
      organisms. Their role in the defense against pathogen attack and their high 
      selectivity for bacterial cells make them attractive for the development of a new 
      class of antimicrobial drugs. The N-terminal fragment of the frog-skin peptide 
      esculentin-1b (Esc(1-18)) has shown broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Similarly 
      to most cationic AMPs, it is supposed to act by binding to and damaging the 
      negatively charged plasma membrane of bacteria. Differently from many other AMPs, 
      Esc(1-18) activity is preserved in biological fluids such as serum. In this work, a 
      structural investigation was performed through NMR spectroscopy. The 3D structure 
      was obtained in the presence of either zwitterionic or negatively charged micelles 
      as membrane models for eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes, respectively. Esc(1-18) 
      showed a higher affinity for and deeper insertion into the latter and adopted an 
      amphipathic helical structure characterized by a kink at the residue G8. These 
      findings were confirmed by measuring penetration into lipid monolayers. The presence 
      of negatively charged lipids in the bilayer appears to be necessary for Esc(1-18) to 
      bind, to fold in the right three-dimensional structure, and, ultimately, to exert 
      its biological role as an AMP.

TI  - Alignment-based design and synthesis of new antimicrobial Aurein-derived peptides 
      with improved activity against Gram-negative bacteria and evaluation of their 
      toxicity on human cells.

AB  - Considering the worldwide increasing prevalence of resistance to traditional 
      antibiotics, it is necessary to find new antibiotics to deal with this issue. 
      Recently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proposed as new antimicrobial 
      agents. Aureins are a family of AMPs that are isolated from Green and Golden Bell 
      Frogs. These peptides have a favorable antibacterial activity against Gram-positive 
      bacteria. We designed two peptides derived from natural Aurein enjoying 
      alignment-based design method. After synthesis of the peptides, their secondary 
      structure was checked by circular dichroism. Consequently, the antibacterial effects 
      of these peptides were investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) and bactericidal concentration. Eventually, the toxicity of 
      these peptides was determined by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 
      5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on normal human skin cells (Hu02 cell line). 
      Natural Aurein1.2 was used as a natural control to compare the properties in all 
      stages. The results indicated that these new peptides had medium-upward 
      antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 
      Bacillus subtilis (MIC of 8-64 μg/mL) and weak bactericidal activity against 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of 128-256 μg/mL). Also, MTT assays results showed that 
      AureinN2 is less toxic than AureinN1 and Aurein1.2. Toxicity of AureinN2 for Hu02 
      cell lines was between 20 and 40% at the concentration of 8-500 μg/mL. In this 
      study, we were able to improve antimicrobial activity of two synthetic derivatives 
      of the Aurein family against Gram-negative bacteria by using machine-learning 
      algorithm and other in silico methods.

TI  - Limnonectins: a new class of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretion of the 
      Fujian large-headed frog (Limnonectes fujianensis).
PG  - 981-7
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.03.003 [doi]
AB  - Amphibian skin secretions are rich sources of biologically-active peptides with 
      antimicrobial peptides predominating in many species. Several studies involving 
      molecular cloning of biosynthetic precursor-encoding cDNAs from skin or skin 
      secretions have revealed that these exhibit highly-conserved domain architectures 
      with an unusually high degree of conserved nucleotide and resultant amino acid 
      sequences within the signal peptides. This high degree of nucleotide sequence 
      conservation has permitted the design of primers complementary to such sites 
      facilitating "shotgun" cloning of skin or skin secretion-derived cDNA libraries from 
      hitherto unstudied species. Here we have used such an approach using a skin 
      secretion-derived cDNA library from an unstudied species of Chinese frog - the 
      Fujian large-headed frog, Limnonectes fujianensis - and have discovered two 16-mer 
      peptides of novel primary structures, named limnonectin-1Fa (SFPFFPPGICKRLKRC) and 
      limnonectin-1Fb (SFHVFPPWMCKSLKKC), that represent the prototypes of a new class of 
      amphibian skin antimicrobial peptide. Unusually these limnonectins display activity 
      only against a Gram-negative bacterium (MICs of 35 and 70 μM) and are devoid of 
      haemolytic activity at concentrations up to 160 μM. Thus the "shotgun" cloning 
      approach described can exploit the unusually high degree of nucleotide conservation 
      in signal peptide-encoding domains of amphibian defensive skin secretion peptide 
      precursor-encoding cDNAs to rapidly expedite the discovery of novel and functional 
      defensive peptides in a manner that circumvents specimen sacrifice without 
      compromising robustness of data.

TI  - How Membrane-Active Peptides Get into Lipid Membranes.
PG  - 1130-8
LID - 10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00074 [doi]
AB  - The structure-function relationship for a family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      from the skin of Australian tree frogs is discussed and compared with that of 
      peptide toxins from bee and Australian scorpion venoms. Although these 
      membrane-active peptides induce a similar cellular fate by disrupting the lipid 
      bilayer integrity, their lytic activity is achieved via different modes of action, 
      which are investigated in relation to amino acid sequence, secondary structure, and 
      membrane lipid composition. In order to better understand what structural features 
      govern the interaction between peptides and lipid membranes, cell-penetrating 
      peptides (CPPs), which translocate through the membrane without compromising its 
      integrity, are also discussed. AMPs possess membrane lytic activities that are 
      naturally designed to target the cellular membrane of pathogens or competitors. They 
      are extremely diverse in amino acid composition and often show specificity against a 
      particular strain of microbe. Since our antibiotic arsenal is declining precariously 
      in the face of the rise in multiantibiotic resistance, AMPs increasingly are seen as 
      a promising alternative. In an effort to understand their molecular mechanism, 
      biophysical studies of a myriad of AMPs have been reported, yet no unifying 
      mechanism has emerged, rendering difficult the rational design of drug leads. 
      Similarly, a wide variety of cytotoxic peptides are found in venoms, the best known 
      being melittin, yet again, predicting their activity based on a particular amino 
      acid composition or secondary structure remains elusive. A common feature of these 
      membrane-active peptides is their preference for the lipid environment. Indeed, they 
      are mainly unstructured in solution and, in the presence of lipid membranes, quickly 
      adsorb onto the surface, change their secondary structure, eventually insert into 
      the hydrophobic core of the membrane bilayer, and finally disrupt the bilayer 
      integrity. These steps define the molecular mechanism by which these membrane-active 
      peptides lyse membranes. The last class of membrane-active peptides discussed are 
      the CPPs, which translocate across the lipid bilayer without inducing severe 
      disruption and have potential as drug vehicles. CPPs are typically highly charged 
      and can show antimicrobial activity by targeting an intracellular target rather than 
      via a direct membrane lytic mechanism. A critical aspect in the structure-function 
      relationship of membrane-active peptides is their specific activity relative to the 
      lipid membrane composition of the cell target. Cell membranes have a wide diversity 
      of lipids, and those of eukaryotic and prokaryotic species differ greatly in 
      composition and structure. The activity of AMPs from Australian tree frogs, toxins, 
      and CPPs has been investigated within various lipid systems to assess whether a 
      relationship between peptide and membrane composition could be identified. NMR 
      spectroscopy techniques are being used to gain atomistic details of how these 
      membrane-active peptides interact with model membranes and cells, and in particular, 
      competitive assays demonstrate the difference between affinity and activity for a 
      specific lipid environment. Overall, the interactions between these relatively small 
      sized peptides and various lipid bilayers give insight into how these peptides 
      function at the membrane interface.

      "shotgun" cDNA cloning and sequence analysis.
PG  - 36-41
AB  - Amphibian skin secretions are rich in antimicrobial peptides that act as important 
      components of an innate immune system. Here, we describe a novel "shotgun" skin 
      peptide precursor cloning technique that facilitates rapid access to these 
      genetically encoded molecules and effects their subsequent identification and 
      structural characterization from the secretory peptidome. Adopting this approach on 
      a skin secretion-derived library from a hitherto unstudied Chinese species of frog, 
      we identified a family of novel antimicrobial peptide homologs, named pelophylaxins, 
      that belong to previously identified families (ranatuerins, brevinins and temporins) 
      found predominantly in the skin secretions from frogs of the genus Rana. These data 
      further substantiate the scientifically robust nature of applying parallel 
      transcriptome and peptidome analyses on frog defensive skin secretions that can be 
      obtained in a non-invasive, non-destructive manner. In addition, the present data 
      illustrate that rapid structural characterization of frog skin secretion peptides 
      can be achieved from an unstudied species without prior knowledge of primary 
      structures of endogenous peptides.

AB  - The Mexican burrowing toad Rhinophrynus dorsalis is the sole extant representative 
      of the Rhinophrynidae. United in the superfamily Pipoidea, the Rhinophrynidae is 
      considered to be the sister-group to the extant Pipidae which comprises 
      Hymenochirus, Pipa, Pseudhymenochirus and Xenopus. Cationic, α-helical host-defense 
      peptides of the type found in Hymenochirus, Pseudhymenochirus, and Xenopus species 
      (hymenochirins, pseudhymenochirins, magainins, and peptides related to PGLa, XPF, 
      and CPF) were not detected in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of R. 
      dorsalis. Skin secretions of representatives of the genus Pipa also do not contain 
      cationic α-helical host-defense peptides which suggest, as the most parsimonious 
      hypothesis, that the ability to produce such peptides by frogs within the Pipidae 
      family arose in the common ancestor of (Hymenochirus+Pseudhymenochirus)+Xenopus 
      after divergence from the line of evolution leading to extant Pipa species. 
      Peptidomic analysis of the R. dorsalis secretions led to the isolation of 
      rhinophrynin-27, a proline-arginine-rich peptide with the primary structure 
      ELRLPEIARPVPEVLPARLPLPALPRN, together with rhinophrynin-33 containing the C-terminal 
      extension KMAKNQ. Rhinophrynin-27 shows limited structural similarity to the porcine 
      multifunctional peptide PR-39 but it lacks antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. 
      Like PR-39, the peptide adopts a poly-l-proline helix but some changes in the 
      circular dichroism spectrum were observed in the presence of anionic sodium 
      dodecylsulfate micelles consistent with the stabilization of turn structures.

TI  - Five novel antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of the frog, Amolops 
      loloensis.
PG  - 72-6
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpb.2009.10.003 [doi]
AB  - While investigating antimicrobial peptide diversity of Amolops loloensis, five novel 
      antimicrobial peptides belonging to two families were identified from skin 
      secretions of this frog. The first family including two members is esculentin-2-AL 
      (esculentin-2-ALa and -ALb); the second family including three members is 
      temporin-AL (temporin-ALd to -ALf). The family of esculentin-2-AL is composed of 37 
      amino acid residues (aa); the family of temporin-AL is composed of 16, 13 and 10 aa, 
      respectively. All of these antimicrobial peptides showed antimicrobial activities 
      against tested microorganisms. cDNAs encoding precursors of esculentin-2-ALs and 
      temporin-ALs were cloned from the skin cDNA library of A. loloensis. All the 
      precursors share similar overall structures. There is a typical prohormone 
      processing signal (Lys-Arg) located between the acidic propiece and the mature 
      peptide. The antimicrobial peptide family of esculentin-2 is firstly reported in the 
      genus of Amolops. Combined with previous reports, a total of four antimicrobial 
      peptide families have been identified from the genus of Amolops; three of them are 
      also found in the genus of Rana. These results suggest the possible evolutionary 
      connection between the genera Amolops and Rana.

PG  - 1317-26
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.032 [doi]
AB  - Seven cDNA sequences encoding antimicrobial peptide (AMP) precursors were cloned by 
      screening the skin-derived cDNA library of the broad-folded frog, Hylarana 
      latouchii. Seven of the deduced peptides are highly similar to AMPs in five families 
      of brevinin-2 (brevinin-2LTa, brevinin-2LTb, and brevinin-2LTc), esculentin-1 
      (esculentin-1LTa), esculentin-2 (esculentin-2LTa), palustrin-2 (palustrin-2LTa), and 
      temporin (temporin-LTe). The actual sequences and characteristics of mature AMPs 
      were analyzed by RP-HPLC and LC-MS/MS-based proteomics approaches in combination of 
      four different protein digestion processes and by LTQ XL in combination of gas-phase 
      fractionation (GPF) analysis. Moreover, most of the peptides found in this study 
      hardly display hemolytic activity in vitro, suggesting they are promising 
      antimicrobial drug candidates.

TI  - Activity of antimicrobial skin peptides from ranid frogs against Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis, the chytrid fungus associated with global amphibian declines.
PG  - 471-9
AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis, is responsible for recent declines in amphibian populations in 
      Australia, Central America, Europe, and North America. Because the chytrid infects 
      the keratinized epithelium of the skin, we investigated the possible role of 
      antimicrobial peptides produced in the skin as inhibitors of infection and growth. 
      We show here that 10 peptides representing eight families of peptides derived from 
      North American ranid frogs can effectively inhibit growth of this chytrid. The 
      peptides are members of the ranatuerin-1, ranatuerin-2, esculentin-1, esculentin-2, 
      brevinin-2, temporin, palustrin-3, and ranalexin families. All the tested peptides 
      inhibit growth of mature fungal cells at concentrations above 25 microM, and some of 
      them inhibit at concentrations as low as 2 microM. A comparison of the sensitivity 
      of infectious zoospores with that of mature cells showed that the zoospores are 
      inhibited at significantly lower concentrations of peptides. To determine whether 
      cold temperature interferes with the inhibitory effects of these peptides, we tested 
      their effectiveness at both 22 and 10 degrees C. Although the peptides inhibit at 
      both temperatures, they appear to be more effective against zoospores at the lower 
      temperature. These results suggest that the ranid frogs have, within their 
      repertoire of antimicrobial substances, a number of skin peptides that should be a 
      deterrent to chytrid infection. This may provide some natural resistance to 
      infection, but if environmental factors inhibit the synthesis and release of the 
      skin peptides, the pathogen could gain the advantage.

TI  - Involvement of Rel factors in the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in 
      amphibia.
PG  - 443-9
AB  - Genes coding for antimicrobial peptides in amphibia reveal a remarkably high number 
      of structural motifs for response elements, previously identified in the genes of 
      insect antimicrobial peptides and in those of the mammalian acute phase response. 
      This study focuses on the functional analysis of the bombinin gene promoter in a 
      Drosophila blood cell line, and the identification of kappaB-binding factors in skin 
      secretions of the frog Bombina orientalis. Transfection experiments demonstrated 
      that the bombinin gene promoter was activated in a lipopolysaccharide-dependent 
      manner, and that insect Rel factors target specific sequences in the amphibian gene 
      promoter. After bathing frogs in bacteria, their skin secretions contained 
      kappaB-specific binding complexes, indicating that Rel factors are crucial 
      components in the response against gram-negative bacteria in this species. These 
      results suggest that a common ancestral control mechanism governs the expression of 
      the first line host-defence from insects to vertebrates.

TI  - Design of potent, non-toxic antimicrobial agents based upon the structure of the

PG  - 653-62
LID - 10.1111/j.1747-0285.2012.01363.x [doi]
AB  - Temporin-1CEb shows antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but its 
      therapeutic potential is limited by its haemolysis. In this study, eight 
      temporin-1CEb analogues with altered cationicities and hydrophobicities were 
      synthesized. Increasing cationicity and amphipathicity by substituting neutral and 
      non-polar amino acid residues on the hydrophilic face of the α-helix by five or six 
      lysines increased antimicrobial potency approximately 10-fold to 40-fold, although 
      when the number of positive charges was increased from +6 to +7, the antimicrobial 
      potency was not additionally enhanced. The substitution of an l-lysine with a 
      d-lysine, meanwhile maintaining the net charge and the mean hydrophobicity values, 
      had only a minor effect on its antimicrobial activity, whereas significantly led a 
      decrease in its haemolytic activity. Of all the peptides, l-K6 has the best 
      potential as an antimicrobial agent because its antimicrobial activity against both 
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is substantial, and its haemolytic activity 
      is negligible. l-K6 adopts an α-helix in 50% trifluoroethanol/water and 30 mm SDS 
      solutions. l-K6 killed 99.9% of E. coli and S. aureus at 4× MIC in 60 min, and its 
      postantibiotic effect was >5 h. l-K6 affects the integrity of E. coli and S. aureus 
      plasma membranes by rapidly inducing membrane depolarization.

      frog skin-derived peptide esculentin-1a(1-21)NH(2).

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a key role in the defence mechanism of living 
      organisms against microbial pathogens, displaying both bactericidal and 
      immunomodulatory properties. They are considered as a promising alternative to the 
      conventional antibiotics towards which bacteria are becoming highly resistant. 
      Recently, a derivative of the frog skin AMP esculentin-1a, esculentin-1a(1-21)NH(2) 
      [Esc(1-21)], showed a strong and fast membranolytic activity against Gram-negative 
      bacteria but with a lower efficacy against Gram-positive ones. Here, with the aim to 
      increase the α-helicity of Esc(1-21) and the expected potency against Gram-positive 
      bacteria, we designed an analog bearing three α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues 
      at positions 1, 10, and 18 of its primary structure. We demonstrated that the 
      incorporation of Aib residues: (1) promoted the α-helix conformation of Esc(1-21), 
      as confirmed by circular dichroism and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopies; (2) was sufficient to make this analog more active than the parent 
      peptide against several Gram-positive bacterial strains without affecting its 
      activity against Gram-negative bacteria; and (3) resulted to be devoid of toxic 
      effect toward epithelial cells at the active antimicrobial concentrations. These 
      results suggest that replacement of L-amino acids with Aib residues has beneficial 
      effects on the structure and properties of the membrane-active peptide Esc(1-21), 
      making it a better candidate for the design and development of selective drugs 
      against Gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - The antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin 01 (DS 01), from the skin secretion of 
      Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis frogs, was immobilized in nanostructured layered films 
      in conjunction with nickel tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines (NiTsPc), widely used in 
      electronic devices, using layer-by-layer technique. The films were used as a 
      biosensor to detect the presence of dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter associated 
      with diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, with detection limits in the 
      order of 10(-6) mol L(-1). The use of DS 01 in LbL film generated selectivity in the 
      detection of DA despite the presence of ascorbic acid found in biological fluids. 
      This work is the first to report that the antimicrobial peptide and NiTsPc LbL film 
      exhibits electroanalytical activity to DA oxidation. The selectivity in the 
      detection of DA is a fundamental aspect for the development of electrochemical 
      sensors with potential applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - The coding sequence, which corresponds to the mature antimicrobial peptide ranalexin 
      from the frog Rana catesbeiana, was chemically synthesized with preferred codons for 
      expression in Escherichia coli. It was cloned into the vector pET32c (+) to express 
      a thioredoxin-ranalexin fusion protein which was produced in soluble form in E. coli 
      BL21 (DE3) induced under optimized conditions. After two purification steps through 
      affinity chromatography, about 1 mg of the recombinant ranalexin was obtained from 1 
      L of culture. Mass spectrometrical analysis of the purified recombinant ranalexin 
      demonstrated its identity with ranalexin. The purified recombinant ranalexin is 
      biologically active. It showed antibacterial activities similar to those of the 
      native peptide against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, and 
      multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration 
      values between 8 and 128 μg/ml. The recombinant ranalexin is also cytotoxic in HeLa 
      and COS7 human cancer cells (IC50 = 13-15 μg/ml).

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from hylid and ranin frogs originated from a 
      150-million-year-old ancestral precursor with a conserved signal peptide but a 
      hypermutable antimicrobial domain.
PG  - 2068-81
AB  - The dermal glands of frogs produce antimicrobial peptides that protect the skin 
      against noxious microorganisms and assist in wound repair. The sequences of these 
      peptides are very dissimilar, both within and between species, so that the 5000 
      living anuran frogs may produce approximately 100 000 different antimicrobial 
      peptides. The antimicrobial peptides of South American hylid frogs are derived from 
      precursors, the preprodermaseptins, whose signal peptides and intervening sequences 
      are remarkably conserved, but their C-terminal domains are markedly diverse, 
      resulting in mature peptides with different lengths, sequences and antimicrobial 
      spectra. We have used the extreme conservation in the preproregion of 
      preprodermaseptin transcripts to identify new members of this family in Australian 
      and South American hylids. All these peptides are cationic, amphipathic and 
      alpha-helical. They killed a broad spectrum of microorganisms and acted in synergy. 
      42 preprodermaseptin gene sequences from 10 species of hylid and ranin frogs were 
      analyzed in the context of their phylogeny and biogeography and of geophysical 
      models for the fragmentation of Gondwana to examine the strategy that these frogs 
      have evolved to generate an enormous array of peptide antibiotics. The 
      hyperdivergence of modern antimicrobial peptides and the number of peptides per 
      species result from repeated duplications of a approximately 150-million-year-old 
      ancestral gene and accelerated mutations of the mature peptide domain, probably 
      involving a mutagenic, error-prone, DNA polymerase similar to Escherichia coli Pol 
      V. The presence of antimicrobial peptides with such different structures and spectra 
      of action represents the successful evolution of multidrug defense by providing 
      frogs with maximum protection against infectious microbes and minimizing the chance 
      of microorganisms developing resistance to individual peptides. The hypermutation of 
      the antimicrobial domain by a targeted mutagenic polymerase that can generate many 
      sequence changes in a few steps may have a selective survival value when frogs 
      colonizing a new ecological niche encounter different microbial predators.

AB  - A nano-HPLC-ESI-OrbiTrap study involving HCD and ETD spectra has been carried out to 
      clarify the composition of the skin peptidome of brown Russian frogs Rana 
      temporaria. This approach allowed determinantion of 76 individual peptides, 
      increasing 3-fold the identified portion of the peptidome in comparison to that 
      obtained earlier with FTICR MS. A search for the new bradykinin related peptides 
      (BRPs) was carried out by reconstructing mass chromatograms based on the ion current 
      of characteristic b- and y-ions. Several peptides were reported in the secretion of 
      R. temporaria for the first time. The overall antibacterial activity of the skin 
      secretion in general and of one individual peptide (Brevinin 1Tb) was determined 
      using PMEU Spectrion (Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit) technology. The inhibitory 
      effects of these peptides on Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica Serovar 
      typhimutium were equal in scale to that reported for some antibiotics.

TI  - Interactions between chensinin-1, a natural antimicrobial peptide derived from Rana 
      chensinensis, and lipopolysaccharide.
PG  - 719-26
LID - 10.1002/bip.22737 [doi]
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis caused 
      by gram-negative bacterial infections. Therefore, LPS-neutralizing molecules would 
      have important clinical applications. Chensinin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide 
      with atypical structural features, was found in the skin secretions of the Chinese 
      brown frog Rana chensinensis. To understand the role of LPS in the bacterial 
      susceptibility to chensinin-1 and to investigate its anti-endotoxin effects, the 
      interactions of chensinin-1 with LPS were investigated in this study using circular 
      dichroism, in situ IR, isothermal titration calorimetry, and zeta potential. This 
      study is the first to use in situ IR spectroscopy to evaluate the secondary 
      structural changes of this peptide. The capacity of chensinin-1 to block the 
      LPS-dependent cytokine secretion of macrophages was also investigated. Our results 
      show that chensinin-1 can form α-helical structures in LPS suspensions. LPS can 
      affect the antimicrobial activity of chensinin-1, and chensinin-1 was able to 
      mitigate the effects of LPS. These data may facilitate the development of 
      antimicrobial peptides with potent antimicrobial and anti-endotoxin activities.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and 
      have promise as new therapeutic agents. While the adult North American bullfrog 
      (Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana) is a prolific source of high-potency AMPs, the 
      aquatic tadpole represents a relatively untapped source for new AMP discovery. The 
      recent publication of the bullfrog genome and transcriptomic resources provides an 
      opportune bridge between known AMPs and bioinformatics-based AMP discovery. The 
      objective of the present study was to identify novel AMPs with therapeutic potential 
      using a combined bioinformatics and wet lab-based approach. In the present study, we 
      identified seven novel AMP precursor-encoding transcripts expressed in the tadpole. 
      Comparison of their amino acid sequences with known AMPs revealed evidence of mature 
      peptide sequence conservation with variation in the prepro sequence. Two mature 
      peptide sequences were unique and demonstrated bacteriostatic and bactericidal 
      activity against Mycobacteria but not Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. Nine 
      known and seven novel AMP-encoding transcripts were detected in premetamorphic 
      tadpole back skin, olfactory epithelium, liver, and/or tail fin. Treatment of 
      tadpoles with 10 nM 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine for 48 h did not affect transcript 
      abundance in the back skin, and had limited impact on these transcripts in the other 
      three tissues. Gene mapping revealed considerable diversity in size (1.6-15 kbp) and 
      exon number (one to four) of AMP-encoding genes with clear evidence of alternative 
      splicing leading to both prepro and mature amino acid sequence diversity. These 
      findings verify the accuracy and utility of the bullfrog genome assembly, and set a 
      firm foundation for bioinformatics-based AMP discovery.

TI  - Expression of genes encoding antimicrobial and bradykinin-related peptides in skin 
      of the stream brown frog Rana sakuraii.
PG  - 505-14
AB  - Peptidomic analysis of an extract of the skin of the stream brown frog Rana sakuraii 
      Matsui and Matsui, 1990 led to the isolation of a C-terminally alpha-amidated 
      peptide (VR-23; VIGSILGALASGLPTLISWIKNR x NH2) with broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
      activity that shows structural similarity to the bee venom peptide, melittin 
      together with two peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1SKa; 
      FLPVILPVIGKLLNGIL x NH2 and temporin-1SKb; FLPVILPVIGKLLSGIL x NH2), and peptides 
      whose primary structures identified them as belonging to the brevinin-2 (2 peptides) 
      and ranatuerin-2 (1 peptide) families. Using a forward primer that was designed from 
      a conserved region of the 5'-untranslated regions of Rana temporaria preprotemporins 
      in a 3'-RACE procedure, a cDNA clone encoding preprotemporin-1SKa was prepared from 
      R. sakuraii skin total RNA. Further preprotemporin cDNAs encoding temporin-1SKc 
      (AVDLAKIANIAN KVLSSL F x NH2) and temporin-1SKd (FLPMLAKLLSGFL x NH2) were obtained 
      by RT-PCR. Unexpectedly, the 3'-RACE procedure using the same primer led to 
      amplification of a cDNA encoding a preprobradykinin whose signal peptide region was 
      identical to that of preprotemporin-1SKa except for the substitution Ser18-->Asn. R. 
      sakuraii bradykinin ([Arg0,Leu1,Thr6,Trp8] BK) was 28-fold less potent than 
      mammalian BK in effecting B2 receptor-mediated relaxation of mouse trachea and the 
      des[Arg0] derivative was only a weak partial agonist. The evolutionary history of 
      the Japanese brown frogs is incompletely understood but a comparison of the primary 
      structures of the R. sakuraii dermal peptides with those of Tago's brown frog Rana 
      tagoi provides evidence for a close phylogenetic relationship between these species.

TI  - The Chinese bamboo leaf odorous frog (Rana (Odorrana) versabilis) and North American 
      Rana frogs share the same families of skin antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 1738-44
AB  - The Chinese bamboo leaf odorous frog (Rana (Odorrana) versabilis) and the North 
      American pickerel frog (Rana palustris) occupy different ecological niches on two 
      different continents with no overlap in geographical distribution. R. palustris skin 
      secretions contain a formidable array of antimicrobial peptides including homologs 
      of brevinin-1, esculentin-1, esculentin-2, ranatuerin-2, a temporin and a family of 
      peptides considered of unique structural attributes when isolated, palustrins 1-3. 
      Here we describe the structures of mature peptides and precursors of eight putative 
      antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretion of the Chinese bamboo leaf odorous 
      frog (Rana (Odorrana) versabilis). Each peptide represents a structural homolog of 
      respective peptide families isolated from R. palustris, including two peptides 
      identical in primary structure to palustrin 1c and palustrin 3b. Additionally, two 
      peptides were found to be structural homologs of ranatuerin 2B and ranatuerin 2P 
      from the closely-related North American species, Rana berlandieri (the Rio Grande 
      leopard frog) and Rana pipiens (the Northern leopard frog), respectively. Both 
      palustrins and ranatuerins have hitherto been considered unique to North American 
      ranid frogs. The use of primary structures of amphibian skin antimicrobial peptides 
      is thus questionable as a taxonomic device or alternatively, the micro-evolution 
      and/or ancestry of ranid frogs is more highly complex than previously thought.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the South-East Asian frog 
      Hylarana erythraea (Ranidae).
PG  - 548-54
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.12.013 [doi]
AB  - Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the South-East 
      Asian frog Hylarana erythraea (formerly Rana erythraea partim) has led to the 
      identification of multiple peptides with antimicrobial activity. Structural 
      characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they belong to the brevinin-1 
      (3), brevinin-2 (2), esculentin-2 (4), and temporin (1) families. The values in 
      parentheses indicate the number of paralogs. In addition, a peptide 
      (GVIKSVLKGVAKTVALG ML.NH(2)) was isolated that shows some structural similarity to 
      the brevinin-2-related peptides (B2RP) previously isolated from North American frogs 
      of the genus Lithobates. A synthetic replicate of the species B2RP showed 
      broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of Escherichia 
      coli (MIC=12.5 microM), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=12.5 microM) and Candida albicans 
      (MIC=50 microM) and was active against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of 
      Acetinobacter baumannii (MIC in the range 6-12.5 microM). The hemolytic activity of 
      the peptide was relatively low (LC(50)=280 microM). Phylogenetic analysis based upon 
      the amino acid sequences of 47 brevinin-2 peptides from 17 Asian species belonging 
      to the family Ranidae provides support for the placement of H. erythraea in the 
      genus Hylarana.

TI  - Effect of membrane composition on antimicrobial peptides aurein 2.2 and 2.3 from 
      Australian southern bell frogs.
PG  - 552-65
LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.012 [doi]
AB  - The effects of hydrophobic thickness and the molar phosphatidylglycerol (PG) content 
      of lipid bilayers on the structure and membrane interaction of three cationic 
      antimicrobial peptides were examined: aurein 2.2, aurein 2.3 (almost identical to 
      aurein 2.2, except for a point mutation at residue 13), and a carboxy C-terminal 
      analog of aurein 2.3. Circular dichroism results indicated that all three peptides 
      adopt an alpha-helical structure in the presence of a 3:1 molar mixture of 
      1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] 
      (DMPC/DMPG), and 1:1 and 3:1 molar mixtures of 
      1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] 
      (POPC/POPG). Oriented circular dichroism data for three different lipid compositions 
      showed that all three peptides were surface-adsorbed at low peptide concentrations, 
      but were inserted into the membrane at higher peptide concentrations. The (31)P 
      solid-state NMR data of the three peptides in the DMPC/DMPG and POPC/POPG bilayers 
      showed that all three peptides significantly perturbed lipid headgroups, in a 
      peptide or lipid composition-dependent manner. Differential scanning calorimetry 
      results demonstrated that both amidated aurein peptides perturbed the overall phase 
      structure of DMPC/DMPG bilayers, but perturbed the POPC/POPG chains less. The nature 
      of the perturbation of DMPC/DMPG bilayers was most likely micellization, and for the 
      POPC/POPG bilayers, distorted toroidal pores or localized membrane aggregate 
      formation. Calcein release assay results showed that aurein peptide-induced membrane 
      leakage was more severe in DMPC/DMPG liposomes than in POPC/POPG liposomes, and that 
      aurein 2.2 induced higher calcein release than aurein 2.3 and aurein 2.3-COOH from 
      1:1 and 3:1 POPC/POPG liposomes. Finally, DiSC(3)5 assay data further delineated 
      aurein 2.2 from the others by showing that it perturbed the lipid membranes of 
      intact S. aureus C622 most efficiently, whereas aurein 2.3 had the same efficiency 
      as gramicidin S, and aurein 2.3-COOH was the least efficient. Taken together, these 
      data show that the membrane interactions of aurein peptides are affected by the

TI  - Molecular Cloning and Functional Characterization of Antimicrobial Peptides 
      Brevinin-1ULf and Ulmin-1ULa in the Skin of the Newly Classified Ryukyu Brown Frog 
      Rana ulma.
PG  - 523-531
LID - 10.2108/zs170084 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were previously isolated from the skin of the Ryukyu 
      brown frog Rana okinavana. However, this species has recently been reclassified as 
      two species, i.e., Rana kobai and Rana ulma. As a result, it was determined that 
      AMPs isolated from R. okinavana were in fact products of R. kobai, but not of R. 
      ulma. In the present study, we collected skin samples from the species R. ulma and 
      cloned twelve cDNAs encoding AMP precursors for the acyclic brevinin-1ULa--1ULf, the 
      temporin-ULa-ULc, ranatuerin-2ULa, japonicin-1ULa, and a novel peptide using 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques. The deduced amino acid 
      sequence of the novel peptide had a high similarity to those of Rana chensinensis 
      chensinin-1CEa--1CEc, which were cloned by Zhao et al. ( 2011 ), but had a low 
      similarity with R. chensinensis chensinin-1, which was cloned by Shang et al. ( 2009 
      ). To avoid confusion with these two different chensinin-1 families, we termed our 
      peptide ulmin-1. Among these peptides, we focused on two peptides, brevinin-1ULf and 
      ulmin-1ULa, and examined the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of their synthetic 
      replicates. In broth microdilution assays, growth inhibitory activities against 
      Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans were detected for 
      brevinin-1ULf but not for ulmin-1ULa, whereas scanning electron microscopic 
      observations revealed that both peptides induce morphological abnormalities in these 
      microbes. In addition, binding activity of ulmin-1ULa to the bacterial cell wall 
      component lipoteichoic acid was higher than that of brevinin-1ULf. In contrast, 
      hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of brevinin-1ULf were stronger than those of 
      ulmin-1ULa.

TI  - Purification and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretion 
      of Rana dybowskii.
PG  - 1532-9
AB  - Six antimicrobial peptides designated dybowskins were isolated from the skin 
      secretion of Rana dybowskii, an edible frog in Korea. Dybowskin-1 
      (FLIGMTHGLICLISRKC) and dybowskin-2 (FLIGMTQGLICLITRKC) were isoforms differing in 
      only two amino acid residues at the 7th and 14th positions from the N-terminus, and 
      they showed amino acid sequence similarities with ranalexin peptides. Dybowskin-3 
      (GLFDVVKGVLKGVGKNVAGSLLEQLKCKLSGGC), dybowskin-4 (VWPLGLVICKALKIC), dybowskin-5 
      (GLFSVVTGVLKAVGKNVAKNVGGSLLEQLKCKISGGC), and dybowskin-6 (FLPLLLAGLPLKLCFLFKKC) 
      differed in both size and sequence, and they were, in terms of amino acid sequence 
      similarities, related to brevinin-2, japonicin-2, esculentin-2, and brevinin-1 
      peptides, respectively. All the peptides presented in this paper contained Rana-box, 
      the cyclic heptapeptide domain, which is conserved in other antimicrobial peptides 
      derived from the genus Rana. All the dybowskin peptides showed a broad spectrum of 
      antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (minimum 
      inhibition concentrations (MIC), 12.5 to >100 microg/ml) and against Candida 
      albicans (MIC, 25 to >100 microg/ml). Especially, dybowskin-4 with valine at its 
      N-terminus was the most abundant and showed the strongest antimicrobial activity 
      among all the dybowskin peptides. This result indicates that the dybowskin peptides 
      from R. dybowskii, whose main habitats are mountains or forests, have evolved 
      differently from antimicrobial peptides isolated from other Korean frogs, whose 
      habitats are plain fields.

      secretion of Hylarana guentheri.
PG  - 3077-84
AB  - Linear, amphipathic and cationic antimicrobial peptides have been previously 
      reported from a wide range of amphibian species especially frogs of the genus Rana. 
      Such antimicrobial peptides are attracting increasing attention in pharmacological 
      applications because they mainly act by permeabilizing and disrupting the target 
      cell or virion membranes with a low degree of resistance. The Guenther's frog, 
      Hylarana guentheri, is a Chinese frog of the genus Rana that is widely distributed 
      in Southern China. It is commonly the dominant amphibian species even where the 
      amphibian population is declining. In this study, we describe the isolation, 
      purification, structural and biological characterization of five novel peptides from 
      H. guentheri frog skin secretions that possess antimicrobial activity, including 
      brevinin-2GHa, brevinin-2GHb, brevinin-2GHc, temporin-GH and a novel antimicrobial 
      peptide named guentherin. The cDNAs encoding two novel members of the brevinin-2 
      family, brevinin-2GHb and brevinin-2GHc were also subsequently cloned and sequenced.

TI  - A proposed nomenclature for antimicrobial peptides from frogs of the genus 
      Leptodactylus.
PG  - 1631-2
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.04.016 [doi]
AB  - It is proposed that the current nomenclature by which individual antimicrobial 
      peptides from the skins of frogs belonging to the genus Leptodactylus are named from 
      the species of frog from which they were isolated should be replaced by one that 
      emphasizes the fact that these peptides are evolutionarily related. As the 
      ocellatins from Leptodactylus ocellatus were the first such peptides to be 
      characterized, it is suggested that all orthologous peptides should be described as 
      "ocellatins". Consistent with accepted terminology for other families of 
      antimicrobial peptides, the upper case initial letter of the species is used to 
      indicate their origin and isoforms are designated by numbers. When two species begin 
      with the same initial letter, a second distinguishing letter shall be employed. 
      Thus, the terms ocellatin-1, -2, -3, and -4 are retained for the parent peptides. 
      Fallaxin is replaced by ocellatin-F1, pentadactylin by ocellatin-P1, laticeptin by 
      ocellatin-L1, syphaxin by ocellatin-S1, and the paralogs from L. validus are termed 
      ocellatin-V1, -V2, and -V3.

TI  - Functional characterisation of the 1-18 fragment of esculentin-1b, an antimicrobial 
      peptide from Rana esculenta.
PG  - 1771-7
AB  - Esculentin-1 is a 46-amino acid residue peptide isolated from skin secretions of 
      Rana esculenta, displaying the most potent antimicrobial activity among the 
      bioactive molecules found in the secretion, with negligible effects on eukaryotic 
      cell membranes. From skin secretions, the 19-46 fragment of esculentin-1, devoid of 
      antibacterial activity, was also isolated. We studied in detail the activity of the 
      N-terminal fragment (1-18) of esculentin-1 using a synthetic amidated analogue. The 
      results show that this fragment is highly active against most bacterial and fungal 
      species, although at a lower extent than the full-length peptide, being four-fold 
      more potent against Phytophthora nicotianae. It has a reduced activity against human 
      erythrocytes with respect to the full-length peptide. The killing curves in liquid 
      medium are similar for the two molecules and the shorter peptide is able to increase 
      the bacterial outer and inner membrane permeability. Overall these data indicate 
      that the antimicrobial properties of esculentin-1 are exerted by its N-terminal 1-18 
      region and that the positively charged residue distribution as well as peptide 
      length represent important determinants for cell selectivity.

TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South 
      American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
PG  - 393-7
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the 
      South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two 
      peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a 
      previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as 
      Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-Val-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. 
      The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, 
      is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean 
      mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference 
      strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria 
      (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, 
      Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 
      25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human 
      erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).

AB  - The development of a robust and portable biosensor for the detection of pathogenic 
      bacteria could impact areas ranging from water-quality monitoring to testing of 
      pharmaceutical products for bacterial contamination. Of particular interest are 
      detectors that combine the natural specificity of biological recognition with 
      sensitive, label-free sensors providing electronic readout. Evolution has tailored 
      antimicrobial peptides to exhibit broad-spectrum activity against pathogenic 
      bacteria, while retaining a high degree of robustness. Here, we report selective and 
      sensitive detection of infectious agents via electronic detection based on 
      antimicrobial peptide-functionalized microcapacitive electrode arrays. The 
      semiselective antimicrobial peptide magainin I--which occurs naturally on the skin 
      of African clawed frogs--was immobilized on gold microelectrodes via a C-terminal 
      cysteine residue. Significantly, exposing the sensor to various concentrations of 
      pathogenic Escherichia coli revealed detection limits of approximately 1 
      bacterium/μL, a clinically useful detection range. The peptide-microcapacitive 
      hybrid device was further able to demonstrate both Gram-selective detection as well 
      as interbacterial strain differentiation, while maintaining recognition capabilities 
      toward pathogenic strains of E. coli and Salmonella. Finally, we report a simulated 
      "water-sampling" chip, consisting of a microfluidic flow cell integrated onto the 
      hybrid sensor, which demonstrates real-time on-chip monitoring of the interaction of 
      E. coli cells with the antimicrobial peptides. The combination of robust, 
      evolutionarily tailored peptides with electronic read-out monitoring electrodes may 
      open exciting avenues in both fundamental studies of the interactions of bacteria 
      with antimicrobial peptides, as well as the practical use of these devices as 
      portable pathogen detectors.

TI  - Antitumor effects and cell selectivity of temporin-1CEa, an antimicrobial peptide 
      from the skin secretions of the Chinese brown frog (Rana chensinensis).
PG  - 434-41
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.08.011 [doi]
AB  - Many antimicrobial peptides from amphibian exhibit additional anticancer properties 
      due to a similar mechanism of action at both bacterial and cancer cells. We have 
      previously reported the cDNA sequence of the antimicrobial peptide temporin-1CEa 
      precursor cloned from the Chinese brown frog Rana chensinensis. In this study, we 
      purified, synthesized and structurally characterized temporin-1CEa from the skin 
      secretions of R. chensinensis. The cytotoxicity and cell selectivity of 
      temporin-1CEa were further examined on twelve human carcinoma cell lines and on 
      normal human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs). Our results indicated 
      that temporin-1CEa has the amino acid sequence of FVDLKKIANIINSIF-NH(2), and 
      exhibits 50-56% identity with temporin family peptides from other frog species. The 
      CD spectra for temporin-1CEa adopted a well-defined α-helical structure in 50% 
      TFE/water solution. The results of MTT assay showed that temporin-1CEa exhibits 
      cytotoxicity to all tested cancer cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, 
      being MCF-7 cells the most sensitive. Moreover, temporin-1CEa had lower hemolytic 
      effect to human erythrocytes and had no significant cytotoxicity to normal HUVSMCs 
      at concentrations showed potent antitumor activity. In summary, temporin-1CEa, an 
      amphiphilic α-helical cationic peptide, may represent a novel anticancer agent for 
      breast cancer therapy, considering its cancer cell selectivity and relatively lower 
      cytotoxicity to normal cells.

TI  - Interactive effects of competition and predator cues on immune responses of leopard 
      frogs at metamorphosis.
PG  - 351-8
LID - 10.1242/jeb.091611 [doi]
AB  - Recent hypotheses suggest that immunosuppression, resulting from altered 
      environmental conditions, may contribute to the increased incidence of amphibian 
      disease around the world. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in amphibian skin are an 
      important innate immune defense against fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens. Their 
      release is tightly coupled with release of the stress hormone noradrenaline 
      (norepinephrine). During metamorphosis, AMPs may constitute the primary immune 
      response in the skin of some species because acquired immune functions are 
      temporarily suppressed in order to prevent autoimmunity against new adult antigens. 
      Suppression of AMPs during this transitional stage may impact disease rates. We 
      exposed leopard frog tadpoles (Lithobates pipiens) to a factorial combination of 
      competitor and caged-predator environments and measured their development, growth 
      and production of hydrophobic skin peptides after metamorphosis. In the absence of 
      predator cues, or if the exposure to predator cues was late in ontogeny, competition 
      caused more than a 250% increase in mass-standardized hydrophobic skin peptides. 
      Predator cues caused a decrease in mass-standardized hydrophobic skin peptides when 
      the exposure was late in ontogeny under low competition, but otherwise had no 
      effect. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of the skin peptides showed 
      that they include six AMPs in the brevinin and temporin families and at least three 
      of these peptides are previously uncharacterized. Both of these peptide families 
      have previously been shown to inhibit harmful microbes including Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis, the fungal pathogen associated with global amphibian declines. Our 
      study shows that amphibians may be able to adjust their skin peptide defenses in 
      response to stressors that are experienced early in ontogeny and that these effects 
      extend through an important life-history transition.

TI  - A helix-induced oligomeric transition of gaegurin 4, an antimicrobial peptide 
      isolated from a Korean frog.
PG  - 229-36
AB  - Gaegurin 4 (GGN4), a novel peptide isolated from the skin of a Korean frog, Rana 
      rugosa, has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. A number of amphipathic peptides 
      closely related to GGN4 undergo a coil to helix transition with concomitant 
      oligomerization in lipid membranes or membrane-mimicking environments. Despite 
      intensive study of their secondary structures, the oligomeric states of the peptides 
      before and after the transition are not well understood. To clarify the structural 
      basis of its antibiotic action, we used analytical ultracentrifugation to define the 
      aggregation state of GGN4 in water, ethyl alcohol, and 
      1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). The maximum size of GGN4 in 15% HFIP 
      corresponded to a decamer, whereas it was monomeric in buffer. The oligomeric 
      transition is accompanied by a cooperative 9 nm blue-shift of maximum fluorescence 
      emission and a large secondary structure change from an almost random coil to an 
      alpha-helical structure. GGN4 induces pores in lipid membranes and, using 
      electrophysiological methods, we estimated the diameter of the pores to be exceed 
      7.3 A, which suggests that the minimal oligomer structure responsible is a pentamer.

TI  - APD2: the updated antimicrobial peptide database and its application in peptide 
      design.
PG  - D933-7
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkn823 [doi]
AB  - The antimicrobial peptide database (APD, http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.php) has been 
      updated and expanded. It now hosts 1228 entries with 65 anticancer, 76 antiviral (53 
      anti-HIV), 327 antifungal and 944 antibacterial peptides. The second version of our 
      database (APD2) allows users to search peptide families (e.g. bacteriocins, 
      cyclotides, or defensins), peptide sources (e.g. fish, frogs or chicken), 
      post-translationally modified peptides (e.g. amidation, oxidation, lipidation, 
      glycosylation or d-amino acids), and peptide binding targets (e.g. membranes, 
      proteins, DNA/RNA, LPS or sugars). Statistical analyses reveal that the frequently 
      used amino acid residues (>10%) are Ala and Gly in bacterial peptides, Cys and Gly 
      in plant peptides, Ala, Gly and Lys in insect peptides, and Leu, Ala, Gly and Lys in 
      amphibian peptides. Using frequently occurring residues, we demonstrate 
      database-aided peptide design in different ways. Among the three peptides designed, 
      GLK-19 showed a higher activity against Escherichia coli than human LL-37.

TI  - Identification and characterisation of a novel antimicrobial polypeptide from the 
      skin secretion of a Chinese frog (Rana chensinensis).

AB  - Amphibians secrete small antimicrobial polypeptides from their skin that have been 
      explored as alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In this study, mass 
      spectrometry was used to identify and characterise protein secretions from the skin 
      of a Chinese frog, Rana chensinensis. The skin of this kind of frog has been used in 
      traditional Chinese medicine for centuries as a remedy against inflammation. A novel 
      antimicrobial peptide was identified and the characteristics of this peptide were 
      analysed using far-ultraviolet circular dichroism. When dissolved in aqueous 
      solution, the peptide displayed a high level of random coil structure, in contrast 
      to a more ordered alpha-helical structure when dissolved in 50% trifluoroethanol. 
      Functional studies showed that this peptide has potent antimicrobial activity both 
      against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and has extremely low haemolytic 
      activity to human red blood cells. Taken together, these studies suggest that this 
      novel peptide can be further developed as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  - Antibacterial and leishmanicidal activities of temporin-SHd, a 17-residue long 
      membrane-damaging peptide.

AB  - Temporins are a family of short antimicrobial peptides (8-17 residues) that mostly 
      show potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Herein, we demonstrate that 
      temporin-SHd, a 17-residue peptide with a net charge of +2 
      (FLPAALAGIGGILGKLF(amide)), expressed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. 
      This peptide displayed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-negative and 
      Gram-positive bacteria, including multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
      strains, as well as antiparasitic activity against promastigote and the 
      intracellular stage (amastigote) of Leishmania infantum, at concentration not toxic 
      for the macrophages. Temporin-SHd that is structured in a non-amphipathic α-helix in 
      anionic membrane-mimetic environments, strongly and selectively perturbs anionic 
      bilayer membranes by interacting with the polar head groups and acyl region of the 
      phospholipids, with formation of regions of two coexisting phases: one phase rich in 
      peptide and the other lipid-rich. The disruption of lipid packing within the bilayer 
      may lead to the formation of transient pores and membrane permeation/disruption once 
      a threshold peptide accumulation is reached. To our knowledge, Temporin-SHd 
      represents the first known 17-residue long temporin expressing such broad spectrum 
      of antimicrobial activity including members of the trypanosomatidae family. 
      Additionally, since only a few shorter members (13 residues) of the temporin family 
      are known to display antileishmanial activity (temporins-TA, -TB and -SHa), SHd is 
      an interesting tool to analyze the antiparasitic mechanism of action of temporins.

TI  - New insight into the mechanism of action of the temporin antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 1477-85
LID - 10.1021/bi902166d [doi]
AB  - Temporins constitute a family of amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs) and contain some of the shortest cytotoxic peptides, comprised of only 10-14 
      residues. We have recently investigated two members of this family, temporin A (TA) 
      and temporin L (TL), because of their different spectra of antimicrobial activity 
      and toxicity. Consequently, we developed new analogues with promising biological 
      activities named Pro(3)-TL and Gln(3)-TA. In this work, we performed a detailed NMR 
      analysis of the new analogues in SDS and DPC micelles, which mimic bacterial and 
      mammalian membranes, respectively. NMR studies reveal that strongly hemolytic 
      Gln(3)-TA was in a stable helical conformation along the entire sequence, while 
      weakly hemolytic but antimicrobial Pro(3)-TL showed conformational averaging at the 
      N-terminus. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on TL and Pro(3)-TL 
      were performed in explicit water and DPC micelles. Simulations indicated that both 
      peptides prefer a location at the micelle-water interface; however, Phe(1) of 
      strongly hemolytic TL was embedded more in depth into DPC, and only TL caused a 
      significant distortion of the micelle shape. By combining NMR and computational 
      analyses, we obtained a molecular-level resolution of the interactions between TL 
      and its analogues with membrane mimicking micelles.

PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/1746-6148-8-197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While emerging diseases are affecting many populations of amphibians, 
      some populations are resistant. Determining the relative contributions of factors 
      influencing disease resistance is critical for effective conservation management. 
      Innate immune defenses in amphibian skin are vital host factors against a number of 
      emerging pathogens such as ranaviruses and the amphibian chytrid fungus 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Adult water frogs from Switzerland (Pelophylax 
      esculentus and P. lessonae) collected in the field with their natural microbiota 
      intact were exposed to Bd after experimental reduction of microbiota, skin peptides, 
      both, or neither to determine the relative contributions of these defenses. RESULTS: 
      Naturally-acquired Bd infections were detected in 10/51 P. lessonae and 4/19 P. 
      esculentus, but no disease outbreaks or population declines have been detected at 
      this site. Thus, this population was immunologically primed, and disease resistant. 
      No mortality occurred during the 64 day experiment. Forty percent of initially 
      uninfected frogs became sub-clinically infected upon experimental exposure to Bd. 
      Reduction of both skin peptide and microbiota immune defenses caused frogs to gain 
      less mass when exposed to Bd than frogs in other treatments. Microbiota-reduced 
      frogs increased peptide production upon Bd infection. Ranavirus was undetectable in 
      all but two frogs that appeared healthy in the field, but died within a week under 
      laboratory conditions. Virus was detectable in both toe-clips and internal organs. 
      CONCLUSION: Intact skin microbiota reduced immune activation and can minimize 
      subclinical costs of infection. Tolerance of Bd or ranavirus infection may differ 
      with ecological conditions.

TI  - Effects of thioredoxin: SUMO and intein on soluble fusion expression of an 
      antimicrobial peptide OG2 in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - OG2 is a modified antimicrobial peptide of Palustrin-OG1 (OG1), which is derived 
      from Odorrana grahami frog. OG2 has shown much higher selective antimicrobial 
      activity and lower hemolytic activity than OG1, indicating OG2 may be a promising 
      antimicrobial agent. In this study, we investigated three fusion partners, including 
      thioredoxin, Mxe GyrA intein, and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), each fused 
      with OG2, and examined their effects on the expression level and solubility of OG2 
      in Escherichia coli. The codon-optimized OG2 gene was cloned into pET32a (+) and 
      pTWIN1 for fusion with thioredoxin and Mxe GyrA intein, respectively. In addition, 
      the SUMO-OG2 gene was amplified by splice overlap extension PCR method and was 
      cloned into pET30a (+). All recombinant plasmids were then transformed into E. coli 
      BL21(DE3)pLysS, and the expressed fusion proteins were verified. Upon isopropyl 
      β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction, OG2 fused with thioredoxin (Trx-OG2) 
      showed the highest yield as a soluble fusion protein (50 mg/L), followed by Mxe GyrA 
      intein (44 mg/L) and SUMO (11 mg/L). The thioredoxin-fused protein (Trx-OG2) was 
      then purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography and desalted by 
      Sephadex G25. The OG2 released by both tobacco etch virus protease and enterokinase 
      from Trx-OG2 showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus 
      ATCC25923.

TI  - Transcriptome analyses of immune tissues from three Japanese frogs (genus Rana ) 
      reveals their utility in characterizing major histocompatibility complex class II.
PG  - 994

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Japan and East Asia, endemic frogs appear to be tolerant or not 
      susceptible to chytridiomycosis, a deadly amphibian disease caused by the chytrid 
      fungus Batrachochytridium dendrobatidis (Bd). Japanese frogs may have evolved 
      mechanisms of immune resistance to pathogens such as Bd. This study characterizes 
      immune genes expressed in various tissues of healthy Japanese Rana frogs. RESULTS: 
      We generated transcriptome data sets of skin, spleen and blood from three adult 
      Japanese Ranidae frogs (Japanese brown frog Rana japonica, the montane brown frog 
      Rana ornativentris, and Tago's brown frog Rana tagoi tagoi) as well as whole body of 
      R. japonica and R. ornativentris tadpoles. From this, we identified tissue- and 
      stage-specific differentially expressed genes; in particular, the spleen was most 
      enriched for immune-related genes. A specific immune gene, major histocompatibility 
      complex class IIB (MHC-IIB), was further characterized due to its role in pathogen 
      recognition. We identified a total of 33 MHC-IIB variants from the three focal 
      species (n = 7 individuals each), which displayed evolutionary signatures related to 
      increased MHC variation, including balancing selection. Our supertyping analyses of 
      MHC-IIB variants from Japanese frogs and previously studied frog species identified 
      potential physiochemical properties of MHC-II that may be important for recognizing 
      and binding chytrid-related antigens. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies 
      to generate transcriptomic resources for Japanese frogs, and contributes to further 
      understanding the immunogenetic factors associated with resistance to infectious 
      diseases in amphibians such as chytridiomycosis. Notably, MHC-IIB supertyping 
      analyses identified unique functional properties of specific MHC-IIB alleles that 
      may partially contribute to Bd resistance, and such properties provide a springboard 
      for future experimental validation.

COIS- ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: All samples from adult frogs are 
      identical to those used in a prior study [25] and approved by Hiroshima University 
      Animal Research Committee (approval number G14–2). Depending on the species, adult 
      frogs were collected at different life stages at different locations within 
      Hiroshima prefecture and then raised in captivity at Hiroshima University Institute 
      for Amphibian Biology: in brief, R. japonica originated from multiple egg clusters 
      collected from Etajima, R. ornativentris originated from tadpoles collected from 
      Yoshiwa, and R. tagoi tagoi originated from adults collected from Shobara (full 
      details in Additional file 1: Table S9). S29 tadpole samples were collected from the 
      same location within Hiroshima. The S24 tadpole samples collected from Yokohama were 
      approved by Sokendai Research committee (approval number 46) and with permission 
      from Yokohama Nature Observation Forest Park. All handling of adult and tadpole

AB  - Rana zhenhaiensis, a species of brown frog, is widely distributed in central and 
      south China. In the present study, a total of 14 cDNA sequences encoding eight novel 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were cloned from the synthesized cDNAs of R. 
      zhenhaiensis skin. The eight novel AMPs belong to four families: brevinin-1 (four 
      peptides), brevinin-2 (one peptide), ranatuerin-2 (one peptide) and chensinin-1 (two 
      peptides), five AMPs from the four families (brevinin-1ZHa, brevinin-1ZHb, 
      brevinin-2ZHa, ranatuerin-2ZHa and chensinin-1ZHa) were chemically synthesized, 
      their antimicrobial and hemolytic activities were examined. The results indicated 
      that the five AMPs possess different antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. Of 
      these, brevinin-2ZHa exhibited the strongest and most broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
      activity. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiment was carried out 
      to investigate the potential antimicrobial mechanism of chensinin-1ZHa. The result 
      indicated that chensinin-1ZHa may exert its function through disruption of the 
      bacterial membrane.

PG  - 1069-73
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.03.004 [doi]
AB  - Two families of structurally related C-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial 
      peptides have been identified in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the 
      midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae). The alyteserin-1 peptides 
      (Gly-Leu-Lys-(Asp/Glu)-Ile-Phe-Lys-Ala-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Val-Lys-(Gly/Asn)-Ile-Ala-Ala-His-Val-Ala-(Asn/Ser).NH(2)) 
      show limited structural similarity to the ascaphins from the skins of frogs of the 
      family Leiopelmatidae. Alyteserin-2a 
      (Ile-Leu-Gly-Lys-Leu-Leu-Ser-Thr-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-Asn-Leu.NH(2)) and 
      alyteserin-2b and -2c 
      (Ile-Leu-Gly-Ala-Ile-Leu-Pro-Leu-Val-Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-(Asn/Ser)-Lys-Leu x NH(2)) 
      show limited sequence identity with bombinin H6, present in the skins of frogs of 
      the family Bombinatoridae. The alyteserin-1 peptides show selective growth 
      inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (MIC=25 
      microM) whereas alyteserin-2a is more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=50 microM). The hemolytic activity against human 
      erythrocytes of all peptides tested is relatively weak (LC(50)>100 microM). The data 
      demonstrate that the frogs belonging to the family Alytidae are among those 
      producing dermal antimicrobial peptides that may represent a component of the 
      animal's system of innate immunity.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues 
      against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
PG  - 85-91
AB  - Due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery 
      of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising candidates for future 
      therapeutic use. Amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such AMPs. In the 
      present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five AMPs from 
      three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates 
      belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 
      Acinetobacter baumannii). The peptides tested were temporins A, B, and G from Rana 
      temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [Esc(1-18)] from 
      Rana esculenta; and bombinin H2 from Bombina variegata. When they were tested in 
      buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested 
      (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microM, 
      with only a few exceptions. The temporins were found to be more active against 
      gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; Esc(1-18) 
      showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against 
      the gram-negative species, which were killed by Esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging 
      from 0.5 to 1 microM; bombinin H2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all 
      isolates. Interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin H2 were 
      almost completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of 
      Esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence 
      of 40% serum. This property renders this peptide an attractive molecule for use in 
      the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.

PG  - 176214
LID - 10.1155/2014/176214 [doi]
LID - 176214
AB  - The skin secretions of Neotropical phyllomedusine leaf frogs have proven to be a 
      rich source of biologically active peptides, including antimicrobials. The major 
      families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) reported are the dermaseptins and 
      phylloseptins and the minor families are the dermatoxins, phylloxins, plasticins, 
      distinctins, and medusins. Here, we report a novel AMP of 10 amino acid residues 
      (LRPAILVRIKamide), named balteatide, from the skin secretion of wild Peruvian 
      purple-sided leaf frogs, Phyllomedusa baltea. Balteatide was found to exhibit a 90% 
      sequence identity with sauvatide, a potent myotropic peptide from the skin secretion 
      of Phyllomedusa sauvagei. However, despite both peptides exhibiting only a single 
      amino acid difference (I/T at position 9), sauvatide is devoid of antimicrobial 
      activity and balteatide is devoid of myotropic activity. Balteatide was found to 
      have differential activity against the Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus 
      aureus; the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli; and the yeast, Candida 
      albicans, and unusual for phyllomedusine frog skin AMPs, was most potent (MIC 
      32 mg/L) against the yeast. Balteatide was also devoid of haemolytic activity up to 
      concentrations of 512 mg/L. Phyllomedusine frog skin secretions thus continue to 
      provide novel AMPs, some of which may provide templates for the rational design of 
      new classes of anti-infective therapeutics.

AB  - Introduction: The emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms has necessitated a 
      search for new antimicrobial agents. Skin secretions of many frog species contain 
      peptides that possess potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities 
      and so show promise for development into anti-infective agents. Several such 
      peptides also possess cytokine-mediated anti-inflammatory properties and a range of 
      anti-diabetic activities.Areas covered: A peptidomic approach, involving 
      reversed-phase HPLC and MALDI mass spectrometry, to the comprehensive identification 
      of peptides of potential therapeutic importance in frog skin secretions is described 
      and its advantages over analyses involving bioassays discussed. Peptidomic studies 
      relating to the characterization of peptides with demonstrated antimicrobial, 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties in skin secretions of frogs belonging 
      to the extensive Pipidae and Ranidae families are reviewed.Expert commentary: The 
      initial promise of frog skin peptides as agents to treat infections produced by 
      drug-resistant microorganisms has not been fulfilled although topical applications 
      to treat skin diseases and a role in promoting wound healing remains a possibility. 
      Future directions are more likely to involve the application of such peptides in the 
      treatment of patients with sepsis and related inflammatory conditions and as a 
      component of a therapeutic regime for Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the Japanese mountain brown frog Rana 
      ornativentris: evidence for polymorphism among preprotemporin mRNAs.
PG  - 524-32
AB  - A previous study led to the isolation of antimicrobial peptides belonging to the 
      temporin and brevinin-2 families from a pooled extract of the skin of adult 
      specimens of the Japanese mountain brown frog Rana ornativentris Werner 1903. In 
      order to ascertain whether individual frogs expressed the full complement of 
      temporin genes, we individually cloned cDNAs encoding the temporin precursors from 
      total RNA extracted from the skins of 12 frogs by RT-PCR using a set of 
      preprotemporin-specific primers. All the specimens examined contained mRNAs 
      directing the synthesis of the novel, but inactive, temporin-1Oe (ILPLLGNLLNGLL x 
      NH2). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed marked polymorphism among individual 
      frogs. Twenty-seven distinct preprotemporin-1Oe mRNAs were identified that contained 
      synonymous substitutions in the antimicrobial peptide region and both synonymous and 
      non-synonymous substitutions in the signal peptide and intervening sequence regions. 
      Up to eight preprotemporin-1Oe mRNA variants were found within a single frog. In 
      addition, several cDNAs encoding preprotemporin-1Oa and -1Ob and a single cDNA 
      encoding preprotemporin-1Oc were characterized. Peptidomic analysis of 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions revealed the presence of temporin-1Oe, 
      temporin-1Of (SLILKGLASIAKLF x NH2), temporin-1Og (FLSSLLSKVVSLFT x NH2), four 
      members of the ranatuerin-2 family and one member of the palustrin-2 family in 
      addition to previously characterized temporin and brevinin-2 peptides.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides from a wide range of amphibian species, especially frogs of 
      the genus Rana, have been characterised and are potential therapeutic agents. Here 
      we describe the isolation, purification, and structural and biological 
      characterisation of three novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of 
      the black spotted frog, Rana nigromaculata, from Northeastern China. The peptides 
      were identified as belonging to two known families: the temporin, which was first 
      identified in R. nigromaculata from China, and the brevinin-2. Temporin-1RNa and 
      temporin-1RNb both containing three positive charges and have a high potency against 
      microorganisms (MIC: 3.13-8.3 μM against Gram-positive bacteria, 12.5-25.0 μM 
      against Gram-negative bacteria, and 6.25-12.5 μM against Candida albicans) and a 
      high haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (HC50: 100-150 μM). 
      Brevinin-2RNa contains a single intra-disulphide bridge at the C-terminus that is 
      active towards the tested Gram-positive bacteria but is not active against E. coli 
      and P. aeruginosa. The cDNAs encoding three novel peptide precursors were also 
      subsequently cloned from an R. nigromaculata skin cDNA library and sequenced. The 
      precursors contain 58-72 amino acid residues, which include a conserved signal 
      peptide, acidic propeptide, and the mature temporin-1RNa, temporin-1RNb and 
      brevinin-2RNa. The CD spectra of temporin-1RNa and temporin-1RNb in water, 30 mM SDS 
      and 50 % trifluoroethanol (TFE) indicated that both peptides adopted an aperiodic 
      structure in water and an organised structure with an α-helical conformation in TFE 
      and SDS solution. The conformational transition induced by TFE or SDS reflects the 
      potential ability of temporin-1RNa and temporin-1RNb to interact with anionic 
      membranes.

TI  - Peptidomic approach identifies cruzioseptins, a new family of potent antimicrobial 
      peptides in the splendid leaf frog, Cruziohyla calcarifer.

AB  - Phyllomedusine frogs are an extraordinary source of biologically active peptides. At 
      least 8 families of antimicrobial peptides have been reported in this frog clade, 
      the dermaseptins being the most diverse. By a peptidomic approach, integrating 
      molecular cloning, Edman degradation sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry, a new 
      family of antimicrobial peptides has been identified in Cruziohyla calcarifer. These 
      15 novel antimicrobial peptides of 20-32 residues in length are named cruzioseptins. 
      They are characterized by having a unique shared N-terminal sequence GFLD- and the 
      sequence motifs -VALGAVSK- or -GKAAL(N/G/S) (V/A)V- in the middle of the peptide. 
      Cruzioseptins have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and low haemolytic 
      effect. The most potent cruzioseptin was CZS-1 that had a MIC of 3.77μM against the 
      Gram positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus and the yeast Candida albicans. In 
      contrast, CZS-1 was 3-fold less potent against the Gram negative bacterium, 
      Escherichia coli (MIC 15.11μM). CZS-1 reached 100% haemolysis at 120.87μM. Skin 
      secretions from unexplored species such as C. calcarifer continue to demonstrate the 
      enormous molecular diversity hidden in the amphibian skin. Some of these novel 
      peptides may provide lead structures for the development of a new class of 
      antibiotics and antifungals of therapeutic use. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Through the 
      combination of molecular cloning, Edman degradation sequencing, tandem mass 
      spectrometry and MALDI-TOF MS we have identified a new family of 15 antimicrobial 
      peptides in the skin secretion of Cruziohyla calcarifer. The novel family is named 
      "Cruzioseptins" and contains cationic amphipathic peptides of 20-32 residues. They 
      have a broad range of antimicrobial activity that also includes effective 
      antifungals with low haemolytic activity. Therefore, C. calcarifer has proven to be 
      a rich source of novel peptides, which could become leading structures for the 
      development of novel antibiotics and antifungals of clinical application.

TI  - Purification and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions 
      of the mink frog (Rana septentrionalis).
PG  - 31-8
AB  - Skin secretions were obtained from male, female, and juvenile specimens of the mink 
      frog (Rana septentrionalis) by electric stimulation and shown to contain 10 peptides 
      that differentially inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The elution profiles of 
      secretions from the three groups following reverse-phase HPLC were almost identical 
      indicating that there were no major sexual or developmental differences in chemical 
      composition. Four peptides of the brevinin-1 family, with potent antimicrobial 
      activity and strong hemolytic activity, two members of ranatuerin-2 family and three 
      members of the temporin family, were purified and characterized structurally. A 
      21-amino-acid C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide (GIWDTIKSMGKVFAGKILQNL.NH(2)) with 
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity was also isolated from the skin secretions. 
      This peptide shows limited structural similarity with the N-terminal region of 
      brevinin-2 peptides previously isolated from R. temporaria skin but lacks the 
      C-terminal cyclic heptapeptide domain associated with this family. Molecular and 
      morphological data support the placement of R. septentrionalis in the R. catesbeiana 
      species group, but analysis based upon the distribution of the molecular forms of 
      the antimicrobial peptides is indicative of a closer phylogenetic relationship 
      between R. septentrionalis and the frogs of the R. pipiens and R. boylii groups.

AB  - Peptide XT-7 (GLLGP(5)LLKIA(10)AKVGS(15)NLL.NH(2)) is a cationic, leucine-rich 
      peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog, Silurana tropicalis 
      (Pipidae). The peptide shows potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its 
      therapeutic potential is limited by haemolytic activity (LC(50)=140 microM). The 
      analogue [G4K]XT-7, however, retains potent antimicrobial activity but is 
      non-haemolytic (LC(50)>500 microM). In order to elucidate the molecular basis for 
      this difference in properties, the three dimensional structures of XT-7 and the 
      analogue have been investigated by proton NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling. 
      In aqueous solution, both peptides lack secondary structure. In a 
      2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE-d(3))-H(2)O mixed solvent system, XT-7 is characterised 
      by a right handed alpha-helical conformation between residues Leu(3) and Leu(17) 
      whereas [G4K]XT-7 adopts a more restricted alpha-helical conformation between 
      residues Leu(6) and Leu(17). A similar conformation for XT-7 in 
      1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) micellular media was observed with 
      a helical segment between Leu(3) and Leu(17). However, differences in side chain 
      orientations restricting the hydrophilic residues to a smaller patch resulted in an 
      increased hydrophobic surface relative to the conformation in TFE-H(2)O. Molecular 
      modelling of the structures obtained in our study demonstrates the amphipathic 
      character of the helical segments. It is proposed that the marked decrease in 
      haemolytic activity produced by the substitution Gly(4)-->Lys in XT-7 arises from a 
      decrease in both helicity and hydrophobicity. These studies may facilitate the 
      development of potent but non-toxic anti-infective agents based upon the structure 
      of XT-7.

AB  - Amphibian skin secretions contain biologically-active compounds, such as 
      anti-microbial peptides and trypsin inhibitors, which are used by biomedical 
      researchers as a source of potential novel drug leads or pharmacological agents. 
      Here, we report the application of a recently developed technique within our 
      laboratory to "shotgun" clone the cDNAs encoding two novel but structurally-related 
      peptides from the lyophilised skin secretions of one species of European frog, Rana 
      esculenta and one species of Chinese frog, Odorrana schmackeri. Bioanalysis of the 
      peptides established the structure of a 17-mer with an N-terminal Ala (A) residue 
      and a C-terminal Cys (C) residue with a single disulphide bridge between Cys 12 and 
      17, which is a canonical Kunitz-type protease inhibitor motif (-CKAAFC-). Due to the 
      presence of this structural attribute, these peptides were named kunitzin-RE 
      (AAKIILNPKFRCKAAFC) and kunitzin-OS (AVNIPFKVHLRCKAAFC). Synthetic replicates of 
      these two novel peptides were found to display a potent inhibitory activity against 
      Escherichia coli but were ineffective at inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus 
      aureus and Candida albicans at concentrations up to 160 μM, and both showed little 
      haemolytic activity at concentrations up to 120 μM. Subsequently, kunitzin-RE and 
      kunitzin-OS were found to be a potent inhibitor of trypsin with a Ki of 5.56 μM and 
      7.56 μM that represent prototypes of a novel class of highly-attenuated amphibian 
      skin protease inhibitor. Substitution of Lys-13, the predicted residue occupying the 
      P1 position within the inhibitory loop, with Phe (F) resulted in decrease in trypsin 
      inhibitor effectiveness and antimicrobial activity against Esherichia coli, but 
      exhibits a potential inhibition activity against chymotrypsin.

      molecular cloning in amphibian skin peptidome analysis.

AB  - Peptidomics is a powerful set of tools for the identification, structural 
      elucidation and discovery of novel regulatory peptides and for monitoring the 
      degradation pathways of structurally and catalytically important proteins. Amphibian 
      skin secretions, arising from specialized granular glands, often contain complex 
      peptidomes containing many components of entirely novel structure and unique 
      site-substituted analogues of known peptide families. Following the discovery that 
      the granular gland transcriptome is present in such secretions in a PCR-amenable 
      form, we designed a strategy for peptide structural characterization involving the 
      integration of 'shotgun' cloning of cDNAs encoding peptide precursors, deduction of 
      putative bioactive peptide structures, and confirmation of these structures using 
      tandem MS/MS sequencing. Here, we illustrate this strategy by means of elucidation 
      of the primary structures of nigrocin-2 homologues from the defensive skin 
      secretions of four species of Chinese Odorrana frogs, O. schmackeri, O. livida, O. 
      hejiangensis and O. versabilis. Synthetic replicates of the peptides were found to 
      possess antimicrobial activity. Nigrocin-2 peptides occur widely in the skin 
      secretions of Asian ranid frogs and in those of the Odorrana group, and are 
      particularly well-represented and of diverse structure in some species. Integration 
      of the molecular analytical technologies described provides a means for rapid 
      structural characterization of novel peptides from complex natural libraries in the 
      absence of systematic online database information.

TI  - Rapid identification of precursor cDNAs encoding five structural classes of 
      antimicrobial peptides from pickerel frog (Rana palustris) skin secretion by single 
      step "shotgun" cloning.
PG  - 1605-10
AB  - The skin secretion of the North American pickerel frog (Rana palustris) has long 
      been known to have pronounced noxious/toxic properties and to be highly effective in 
      defence against predators and against other sympatric amphibians. As it consists 
      largely of a complex mixture of peptides, it has been subjected to systematic 
      peptidomic study but there has been little focus on molecular cloning of 
      peptide-encoding cDNAs and by deduction, the biosynthetic precursors that they 
      encode. Here, we demonstrate that the cDNAs encoding the five major structural 
      families of antimicrobial peptides can be elucidated by a single step "shotgun" 
      cloning approach using a cDNA library constructed from the source material of the 
      peptidomic studies--the defensive skin secretion itself. Using a degenerate primer 
      pool designed to a highly conserved nucleic acid sequence 5' to the initiation codon 
      of known antimicrobial peptide precursor transcripts, we amplified cDNA sequences 
      representing five major classes of antimicrobial peptides, such as esculentins, 
      brevinins, ranatuerins, palustrins and temporins. Bioinformatic comparisons of 
      precursor open-reading frames and nucleic acid sequences revealed high degrees of 
      structural similarities between analogous peptides of R. palustris and the Chinese 
      bamboo odorous frog, Rana versabilis. This approach thus constitutes a robust 
      technique that can be used either alone or ideally, in parallel with peptidomic 
      analysis of skin secretion, to rapidly extract primary structural information on 
      amphibian skin secretion peptides and their biosynthetic precursors.

AB  - Gene-encoded peptides with distinct potent bioactivities enable several animals to 
      take advantage of fierce interspecific interaction, as seen in the skin secretion of 
      amphibians. Unlike, most amphibian species that frequently switches 
      terrestrial-aquatic habitats and hides easily from terrestrial predators, tree frogs 
      of small body size are considered as the vulnerable prey in the arboreal habitat. 
      Here, we show the structural and functional diversity of peptide families based on 
      the skin transcriptome of Hyla japonica, which has evolved to be wrapped as an 
      efficient chemical toolkit for defensive use in arboreal habitat. Generally, the 
      presence of antimicrobial peptide and proteinase inhibitor families reveals the 
      functional consistency of Hyla japonica skin compared to other amphibian species. 
      Furthermore, we found that Anntoxin-like neurotoxins with high expression levels are 
      species-specific in tree frogs. Interestingly, derivatives in the Anntoxin-like 
      family exhibit multiple evolutionary traits in modifying the copy number, folding 
      type, and three-dimensional architecture, which are considered essential for 
      targeting the ion channels of terrestrial predators. Together, our study not only 
      reveals the peptide diversity in the skin secretion of H. japonica, but also draws 
      insights into the predator-deterring strategy for coping with arboreal habitat.

      host defense peptides produced by the skin of hylid frogs. The plasticins, which are 
      rich in Gly and Leu residues arranged in regular 5-mer motifs GXXXG (where X is any 
      amino acid residue), have very similar amino acid sequences, hydrophobicities, and 
      amphipathicities but differ markedly in their net charge, conformational plasticity, 
      and activity spectra. The intrinsic flexibility and structural malleability of 
      plasticins modulate their ability to bind to and disrupt the membranes of 
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and/or to reach intracellular targets, therefore 
      triggering functional versatility. This family of closely related but functionally 
      divergent peptides constitutes a good model to address the relationships between 
      structural polymorphism, membrane-interacting properties, and the biological 
      activity of antimicrobial, cell-penetrating, and viral fusion peptides. Plasticins 
      could thus serve as templates to design potent multifunctional drugs that could act 
      simultaneously against bacterial pathogens and viruses.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationship between the relict leopard frog Lithobates (Rana) onca 
      (Cope, 1875) and the lowland leopard frog Lithobates (Rana) yavapaiensis (Platz and 
      Frost, 1984) is unclear. Chromatographic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
      secretions from L. onca led to the identification of six peptides with antimicrobial 
      activity. Determination of their primary structures indicated that four of the 
      peptides were identical to brevinin-1Ya, brevinin-1Yb, brevinin-1Yc and 
      ranatuerin-2Ya previously isolated from skin secretions of L. yavapaiensis. However, 
      a peptide belonging to the temporin family (temporin-ONa: FLPTFGKILSGLF.NH(2)) and 
      an atypical member of the ranatuerin-2 family containing a C-terminal cyclic 
      heptapeptide domain (ranatuerin-2ONa: GLMDTVKNAAKNLAGQMLDKLKCKITGSC) were isolated 
      from the L. onca secretions but were not present in the L. yavapaiensis secretions. 
      Ranatuerin-2ONa inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli (MIC=50muM) and Candida 
      albicans (MIC=100muM ) and showed hemolytic activity (LC(50)=90muM) but was inactive 
      against Staphylococcus aureus. The data indicate a close phylogenetic relationship 
      between L. onca and L. yavapaiensis but suggest that they are not conspecific 
      species.

TI  - Hybridization between the African clawed frogs Xenopus laevis and Xenopus muelleri 
      (Pipidae) increases the multiplicity of antimicrobial peptides in skin secretions of 
      female offspring.
PG  - 285-91
LID - 10.1016/j.cbd.2012.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Peptidomic analysis was used to compare the distribution of host-defense peptides in 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from laboratory-generated female F1 
      hybrids of the common clawed frog Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802) and Mueller's clawed 
      frog Xenopus muelleri (Peters, 1844) with the corresponding distribution in skin 
      secretions from the parent species. A total of 18 peptides were identified in 
      secretions from the hybrid frogs. Eleven peptides (magainin-1, magainin-2, CPF-1, 
      CPF-3, CPF-4, CPF-5, CPF-6, CPF-7, XPF-1, XPF-2, and PGLa) were identified in 
      secretions of both the hybrids and X. laevis. Four peptides (magainin-M1, XPF-M1, 
      CPF-M1, and tigerinin-M1) were previously found in skin secretions of X. muelleri 
      but magainin-M2 and CPF-M2 from X. muelleri were not detected. Three previously 
      undescribed peptides (magainin-LM1, PGLa-LM1, and CPF-LM1) were purified from the 
      secretions of the hybrid frogs that were not detected in secretions from either X. 
      laevis or X. muelleri. Magainin-LM1 differs from magainin-2 from X. laevis by a 
      single amino acid substitution (Gly(13)→Ala) but PGLa-LM1 and CPF-LM1 differ 
      appreciably in structure from orthologs in the parent species. CPF-LM1 shows potent, 
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is hemolytic. The data indicate that 
      hybridization increases the multiplicity of skin host-defense peptides in skin 
      secretions. As the female F1 hybrids are fertile, hybridization may represent an 
      adaptive strategy among Xenopus species to increase protection against pathogenic 
      microorganisms in the environment.

TI  - Brevinin-1GHd: a novel Hylarana guentheri skin secretion-derived Brevinin-1 type 
      peptide with antimicrobial and anticancer therapeutic potential.
LID - 10.1042/BSR20200019 [doi]
LID - BSR20200019
AB  - Host-defense antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from amphibians are usually considered as 
      one of the most promising next-generation antibiotics because of their excellent 
      antimicrobial properties and low cytotoxicity. In the present study, one novel 
      Brevinin-1 type peptide, Brevinin-1GHd, was isolated and characterized from the skin 
      secretion of the frog, Hylarana guentheri. Brevinin-1GHd was found to possess a wide 
      range of antimicrobial activity through penetrating the bacterial membrane within a 
      short time while showing low hemolysis at bactericidal concentrations, even against 
      the resistant strains. It also inhibited and eradicated biofilms that are thought to 
      be closely related to the rise in resistance. Meanwhile, Brevinin-1GHd exhibited 
      wide-spectrum anti-proliferation activity toward human cancer lines. Taken together, 
      these results indicate that Brevinin-1GHd with its excellent antimicrobial and 
      anticancer activities is a promising candidate for a novel antibiotic agent, and 
      study of its structure-activity relationships also provided a rational template for 
      further research and peptide analog design.

TI  - A revised leopard frog phylogeny allows a more detailed examination of adaptive 
      evolution at ranatuerin-2 antimicrobial peptide loci.
PG  - 333-43
LID - 10.1007/s00251-010-0430-7 [doi]
AB  - Ranatuerins are antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system found in ranid 
      frogs. We previously presented evidence that a positive selective sweep had fixed a 
      single allele at the Ranatuerin2 locus in the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens). 
      In this paper, we further investigate the evolutionary history of ranatuerins as 
      follows. First, we sequenced Ranatuerin2 in additional individuals of R. pipiens and 
      related frog species and compared diversity and divergence at these sequences with 
      that at four putatively neutrally evolving loci. Second, we asked whether the 
      evolutionary patterns observed at Ranatuerin2 were typical for ranatuerin loci by 
      sequencing our samples at a paralogous locus, Ranatuerin2b, and performing the same 
      neutrality tests. Ranatuerin2b also showed strong and significant evidence of at 
      least one selective sweep. Third, we used the neutral loci to independently resolve 
      conflicting hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships among our study species. 
      Both the neutral loci and the ranatuerin loci supported an older phylogeny inferred 
      from allozyme data and strongly rejected a more recent phylogeny inferred from 
      mitochondrial DNA. Finally, in order to test whether the sweep was driven by the 
      evolution of substantially new peptide function, we used the phylogeny to 
      reconstruct the hypothetical Ranatuerin2 peptide that existed before the sweep. We 
      synthesized this peptide and tested its activity and that of the extant peptide 
      against six bacterial pathogens of frogs. We observed antibacterial activity but 
      found no significant functional differences between the two peptides.

PG  - 8205-9
LID - 10.1016/j.bmc.2008.07.032 [doi]
AB  - Dermaseptins are peptides found in the skin secretions of Phyllomedusinae frogs. 
      These peptides exert lytic action on some microorganisms without substantial 
      haemolysis. In an attempt to understand the antimicrobial activity of these peptides 
      we designed several dermaseptin S1 (ALWKTMLKKLGTMALHAGKAALGAAADTISQGTQ) (DS1) 
      analogues. All peptides were tested on the growth of prokaryotic (Gram-positive and 
      Gram-negative bacteria) and eukaryotic (the yeast Candida albicans and the protozoon 
      Leishmania major) organisms. Our data showed a dose-dependent killing effect by most 
      DS1 derivatives. Maximal antibacterial activity was displayed by a 16-mer peptide 
      that was more active than native DS1.

AB  - Human activities impose novel pressures on amphibians, which are experiencing 
      unprecedented global declines, yet population-level responses are poorly understood. 
      A growing body of literature has revealed that noise is an anthropogenic stressor 
      that impacts ecological processes spanning subcellular to ecosystem levels. These 
      consequences can impose novel selective pressures on populations, yet whether 
      populations can adapt to noise is unknown. We tested for adaptation to traffic 
      noise, a widespread sensory 'pollutant'. We collected eggs of wood frogs (Rana 
      sylvatica) from populations from different traffic noise regimes, reared hatchlings 
      under the same conditions, and tested frogs for differences in sublethal 
      fitness-relevant effects of noise. We show that prolonged noise impaired production 
      of antimicrobial peptides associated with defence against disease. Additionally, 
      noise and origin site interacted to impact immune and stress responses. Noise 
      exposure altered leucocyte production and increased baseline levels of the 
      stress-relevant glucocorticoid, corticosterone, in frogs from quiet sites, but 
      noise-legacy populations were unaffected. These results suggest noise-legacy 
      populations have adapted to avoid fitness-relevant physiological costs of traffic 
      noise. These findings advance our understanding of the consequences of novel 
      soundscapes and reveal a pathway by which anthropogenic disturbance can enable 
      adaptation to novel environments.

TI  - A melittin-related peptide from the skin of the Japanese frog, Rana tagoi, with 
      antimicrobial and cytolytic properties.
PG  - 496-500
AB  - Two peptides with antimicrobial and cytolytic properties were purified from an 
      extract of the skin of Tago's brown frog Rana tagoi. The primary structure of one 
      peptide (FLPILGKLLS(10)GIL.NH(2)) identifies it as a member of the temporin family, 
      whereas the second peptide (AIGSILGALA(10)KGLPTLISWI(20)KNR.NH(2)) displays 78% 
      sequence identity to melittin from the venom of the honeybee Apis florea. Compared 
      with melittin, the melittin-related peptide (MRP) was equipotent in inhibiting the 
      growth of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, 5-fold less potent 
      against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and against the fungal 
      pathogen, Candida albicans. MRP was 13-fold less hemolytic than melittin against 
      human erythrocytes and 4- and 5-fold less cytolytic against mouse EL4 
      T-lymphoma-derived cells and L929 fibroblasts, respectively. However, at 
      non-cytotoxic concentrations (<or=8 microM), MRP did not protect HeLa cells from 
      cell death produced by human rhinovirus type 2 infection.

TI  - Solid-state NMR study of antimicrobial peptides from Australian frogs in 
      phospholipid membranes.
PG  - 109-16
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides, isolated from the dorsal glands of Australian tree frogs, 
      possess a wide spectrum of biological activity and some are specific to certain 
      pathogens. These peptides have the capability of disrupting bacterial membranes and 
      lysing lipid bilayers. This study focused on the following amphibian peptides: (1) 
      aurein 1.2, a 13-residue peptide; (2) citropin 1.1, with 16 residues; and (3) 
      maculatin 1.1, with 21 residues. The antibiotic activity and structure of these 
      peptides have been studied and compared and possible mechanisms by which the 
      peptides lyse bacterial membrane cells have been proposed. The peptides adopt 
      amphipathic alpha-helical structures in the presence of lipid micelles and vesicles. 
      Specifically 15N-labelled peptides were studied using solid-state NMR to determine 
      their structure and orientation in model lipid bilayers. The effect of these 
      peptides on phospholipid membranes was determined by 2H and 31P solid-state NMR 
      techniques in order to understand the mechanisms by which they exert their 
      biological effects that lead to the disruption of the bacterial cell membrane. 
      Aurein 1.2 and citropin 1.1 are too short to span the membrane bilayer while the 
      longer maculatin 1.1, which may be flexible due to the central proline, would be 
      able to span the bilayer as a transmembrane alpha-helix. All three peptides had a 
      peripheral interaction with phosphatidylcholine bilayers and appear to be located in 
      the aqueous region of the membrane bilayer. It is proposed that these antimicrobial 
      peptides have a "detergent"-like mechanism of membrane lysis.

TI  - Effect of aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) substitutions on the antimicrobial and 
      cytolytic activities of the frog skin peptide, temporin-1DRa.
PG  - 2075-80
AB  - Temporin-1DRa (HFLGTLVNLAKKIL.NH(2)), first isolated from the skin of the California 
      red-legged frog Rana draytonii, shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its 
      therapeutic potential is limited by its toxicity against mammalian cells. The 
      cytolytic properties of cationic alpha-helical peptides are determined by a complex 
      interaction between cationicity, hydrophobicity, conformation, and amphipathicity. 
      This study has investigated the cytolytic properties of conformationally constrained 
      analogs of temporin-1DRa containing alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) substitutions. 
      Cytolytic activity was determined against the bacteria Escherichia coli and 
      Staphylococcus aureus, the opportunistic yeast pathogen, Candida albicans, human 
      erythrocytes, HepG2 hepatoma-derived cells, and L929 fibroblasts. Aib substitutions 
      at Gly(4), Asn(8), and Ala(10) increased both % helicity, determined in methanol 
      solution, and hydrophobicity resulting in increases in both antimicrobial potencies 
      and toxicities against the mammalian cells. Substitution at Leu(6) resulted in an 
      appreciable decrease in cytolytic activity against all cells whereas the 
      substitutions at His(1), Phe(2), Leu(3), Thr(5), and Val(7) had only minor effects 
      on activity. Substitutions at Leu(9), Ile(13), Leu(14) produced analogs with 
      decreased helicity and hydrophobicity that retained activity against microorganisms 
      but showed appreciably lower cytolytic activities against mammalian cells. In 
      particular, the fourfold increase in therapeutic index [ratio of LC(50) against 
      erythrocytes to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against microorganisms] of 
      [Aib(13)]temporin-1DRa identifies it as a compound with potential for development as 
      a therapeutically valuable anti-infective agent.

TI  - Roles of diversifying selection and coordinated evolution in the evolution of 
      amphibian antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 858-64
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are expressed in the skin of amphibians and are used to 
      prevent infection by microorganisms. Frog species store distinct collections of 
      antimicrobial peptides that show variation in size, charge, conformation, and 
      bactericidal activity, and so the evolution of antimicrobial peptide gene families 
      may reflect the adaptive diversification of these loci. We examined the molecular 
      evolution of antimicrobial peptide transcripts from hylid and ranid frog species. 
      Our results show that after the gene family arose in the common ancestor of the 
      Hylidae and Ranidae, before the divergence of these families in the Mesozoic, it 
      subsequently diversified within these groups with numerous duplication events and 
      divergence of loci. Moreover, we provide evidence that suggests that members of the 
      antimicrobial peptide gene family have been subject to diversifying selection within 
      both propiece and mature domains of hylids and solely within the mature domain of 
      ranids. Finally, our results suggest that coordinated and compensatory amino acid 
      replacements have occurred within the acidic propiece and cationic mature domain of 
      hylid antimicrobial peptide precursors, as has been observed for mammalian defensin 
      genes, but not among those of ranid precursors.

      comparison of DNA sequences of mitochondrial genes has suggested that they may 
      represent separate species. Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
      secretions has led to the identification of six peptides with antimicrobial activity 
      in samples from specimens from both groups. The primary structure of the peptides 
      (esculentin-2 CHa, ranatuerin-2 CHa, -CHb, and -CHc, and brevinin-1 CHa and -CHb) 
      isolated from both southern and northern range frogs are identical consistent with 
      the proposal that the two populations are conspecific. However, palustrin-2CHa and 
      the atypical brevinin-1 CHc (FFPTIAG*****LTKLFCA ITKKC), containing a five amino 
      acid residue deletion, were identified only in secretions from southern range 
      specimens. Consequently, there is some support for the proposal that the two 
      populations are closely related but separate species but this support is relatively 
      weak. Esculentin-2 CHa (GFSSIFRGVAKFASKGLG KDLAKLGVDLVACKISKQC) displayed the 
      highest antimicrobial potency (MIC ≤ 10μM) against a variety of microorganisms and 
      was only moderately hemolytic (LC(50) = 150 μM). Cladistic analysis based upon the 
      primary structures of brevinin-1 peptides indicates a close phylogenetic 
      relationship between L. chiricahuensis, L. onca, and L. yavapaiensis.

TI  - Peptides with antimicrobial activity from four different families isolated from the 
      skins of the North American frogs Rana luteiventris, Rana berlandieri and Rana 
      pipiens.
PG  - 894-900
AB  - The skins of frogs of the genus Rana synthesize a complex array of antimicrobial 
      peptides that may be grouped into eight families on the basis of structural 
      similarity. A total of 24 peptides with differential growth-inhibitory activity 
      towards the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, the Gram-negative 
      bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were isolated from 
      extracts of the skins of three closely related North American frogs, Rana 
      luteiventris (spotted frog), Rana berlandieri (Rio Grande leopard frog) and Rana 
      pipiens (Northern leopard frog). Structural characterization of the antimicrobial 
      peptides demonstrated that they belonged to four of the known families: the 
      brevinin-1 family, first identified in skin of the Asian frog Rana porosa brevipoda; 
      the esculentin-2 family, first identified in the European frog Rana esculenta; the 
      ranatuerin-2 family, first identified in the North American bullfrog Rana 
      catesbeiana; and the temporin family, first identified in the European frog Rana 
      temporaria. Peptides belonging to the brevinin-2, ranalexin, esculentin-1 and 
      ranatuerin-1 families were not identified in the extracts. Despite the close 
      phylogenetic relationship between the various species of Ranid frogs, the 
      distribution and amino-acid sequences of the antimicrobial peptides produced by each 
      species are highly variable and species-specific, suggesting that they may be 
      valuable in taxonomic classification and molecular phylogenetic analysis.

AB  - Brevinin-2GU, a member of a brevinin-2 family of antimicrobial peptides isolated 
      from an extract of the skin of the Asian frog, Hylarana guntheri, displays 
      significant insulin-releasing activity. In this study, in order to obtain relatively 
      large quantity of functional brevinin-2GU protein, the coding sequence of 
      brevinin-2GU gene was cloned into pET32a (+) vector and expression as a Trx fusion 
      protein in Escherichia coli. The results indicated that the expression level of the 
      fusion protein could reach up to 45% of the total cell proteins. the soluble fusion 
      protein collected from the supernatant of the cell lysate was then separated by 
      Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography and cleaved by Factor Xa protease to release mature 
      brevinin-2GU. Our results showed that the final yield of the brevinin-2GU was 1.7 
      mg, the purified peptide displayed insulin-releasing activity similar to that of the 
      purified brevinin that was reported earlier. This method allows production of 
      sufficiently large amounts of brevinin-2GU peptide for functional and structural 
      characterizations.

TI  - Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Host Defense Peptide Temporin L and Its Q3K 
      Derivative: An Atomic Level View from Aggregation in Water to Bilayer Perturbation.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22071235 [doi]
LID - 1235
AB  - Temporin L (TempL) is a 13 residue Host Defense Peptide (HDP) isolated from the skin 
      of frogs. It has a strong affinity for lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which is related 
      to its high activity against Gram-negative bacteria and also to its strong tendency 
      to neutralize the pro-inflammatory response caused by LPS release from inactivated 
      bacteria. A designed analog with the Q3K substitution shows an enhancement in both 
      these activities. In the present paper, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have 
      been used to investigate the origin of these improved properties. To this end, we 
      have studied the behavior of the peptides both in water solution and in the presence 
      of LPS lipid-A bilayers, demonstrating that the main effect through which the Q3K 
      substitution improves the peptide activities is the destabilization of peptide 
      aggregates in water.

TI  - Two antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of Rana grahami.
PG  - 459-64
AB  - Two antimicrobial peptides manifested a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity 
      against various microorganisms have been isolated from skin secretions of Rana 
      grahami. These antimicrobial peptides were named grahamin 1 and grahamin 2. Their 
      primary structures are GLLSGILGAGKNIVCGLSGLC and GLLSGILGAGKHIVCGLSGLC, 
      respectively, determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. They are 
      structurally related to nigrocins identified from skin secretions of the 
      dark-spotted frog, Rana nigromaculata. The cDNA clones encoding the precursor of 
      grahamins were screened and sequenced from the skin cDNA library of R. grahami. The 
      amino sequences deduced from the cDNA sequences match well with the results from 
      Edman degradation. As other antimicrobial peptides from Rana species, grahamins 
      contain a C-terminal loop region delineated by an intra-disulfide bridge named Rana 
      box. Based on structural comparison of grahamin with other known antimicrobial 
      peptides, grahamins could be classified into the family of antimicrobial peptides 
      containing a single intra-disulfide bridge.

AB  - Several frog skin peptides, first identified as result of their antimicrobial or 
      immunomodulatory activities, have subsequently been shown to stimulate insulin 
      release both in vitro and in vivo and so show potential for development into 
      incretin-based drugs for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      However, their therapeutic potential as anti-diabetic agents is not confined to this 
      activity as certain frog skin-derived peptides, such as magainin-AM2 and CPF-SE1 and 
      analogs of hymenochirin-1B, tigerinin-1R, and esculentin-2CHa, have been shown to 
      increase insulin sensitivity, promote β-cell proliferation, suppress pancreatic and 
      circulating glucagon concentrations, improve the lipid profile, and selectively 
      alter expression of genes involved in insulin secretion and action in mice with 
      diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. This review 
      assesses the therapeutic possibilities of peptides from frogs belonging to the 
      Pipidae, Dicroglossidae, and Ranidae families, focusing upon work that has been 
      carried out since 2014.

TI  - Two families of antimicrobial peptides with multiple functions from skin of 
      rufous-spotted torrent frog, Amolops loloensis.
PG  - 3085-91
AB  - There are around 27 species of Amolops amphibian distributed in South-east of Asia. 
      Seven antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) belonging to two different families were 
      purified from skin of rufous-spotted torrent frog, Amolops loloensis, and designated 
      brevinins-ALa, b, c, and d, and temporins-ALa, b, and c. The brevinins-AL family 
      which is structurally related to brevinins-1 from skin secretions of the European 
      frog, Rana brevipoda, is composed of 24 amino acids and has an intra-disulfide 
      bridge at the C-terminus. The temporins-AL family, composed of 13 or 16 amino acid 
      residues, is related with temporins from the skin secretions of R. temporaria. The 
      findings of this study will facilitate the solutions to the taxonomic questions of 
      the ranid genus Amolops and Staurois. In the work of this paper, both brevinins-ALb 
      and temporin-Ma induced mast cell degranulation and histamine release, and had 
      cytotoxic activity toward solid tumor cell line HepG(2). Brevinins-ALb also exerted 
      strong hemolytic activity while temporin-Ma had no such activity.

TI  - Novel families of antimicrobial peptides with multiple functions from skin of Xizang 
      plateau frog, Nanorana parkeri.
PG  - 475-81

AB  - Xizang plateau frog (Nanorana parkeri) captured in Lhasa, Tibet, China, solely lives 
      in the subtropical plateau, where there is strong ultraviolet radiation and long 
      duration of sunshine. Considering its harsh living environment, the frog's innate 
      defense against microbes and environmental stress was investigated. In current 
      study, three antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were purified and characterized from the 
      skin secretion of N. parkeri. The coding cDNA sequences were also cloned from the 
      skin cDNA library of N. parkeri. By structural characterization, two peptides were 
      identified belonging to Japonicin-1 family, and named as Japonicin-1Npa 
      (FLLFPLMCKIQGKC) and Japonicin-1Npb (FVLPLVMCKILRKC). The third peptide isolated 
      named Parkerin with a unique sequence of GWANTLKNVAGGLCKITGAA did not show 
      similarity to any known amphibian AMPs. Multi-functions of three AMPs were examined 
      (antioxidant, MCD, hemolytic etc). Their solution structures determined by CD and 
      antimicrobial mechanisms investigated by SEM are very well consistent with their 
      functional characters. Current result suggests that these novel multi-functional 
      AMPs could play an important role in defending N. parkeri against environmental 
      oxidative stress and pathogenic microorganisms, which may partially reveal the 
      ecological adaptation of these plateau-living amphibians.

AB  - Due to the growing emergence of resistance to commercially available 
      antibiotics/antimycotics in virtually all clinical microbial pathogens, the 
      discovery of alternative anti-infective agents, is greatly needed. Gene-encoded 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold promise as novel therapeutics. In particular, 
      amphibian skin is one of the richest storehouses of AMPs, especially that of the 
      genus Rana, with esculentins-1 being among the longest (46 amino acids) AMPs found 
      in nature to date. Here, we report on the recently discovered in vitro and in vivo 
      activities and mechanism of action of two derivatives of the N-terminal part of 
      esculentin-1a and -1b peptides, primarily against two relevant opportunistic 
      microorganisms causing a large number of life-threatening infections worldwide; i.e. 
      the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. 
      Because of distinct advantages compared to several mammalian AMPs, the two selected 
      frog skin AMP-derivatives represent attractive candidates for the development of new 
      antimicrobial compounds with expanded properties, for both human and veterinary 
      medicine.

AB  - Albeit many bioactive peptides have been reported from amphibian skins, no 
      anti-platelet peptide has been identified till to date. Here, an anti-platelet 
      peptide, namely Zongdian platelet inhibitor (ZDPI), with the molecular weight of 
      1798.6 Da, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the frog, Amolops 
      loloensis. The amino acid sequence of ZDPI was determined as FRGCWLKNYSPRGCL-NH2 by 
      combination methods of Edman degradation, mass spectrometry analysis and 
      carboxypeptidase Y treatment revealing that it is composed of 15 amino acid residues 
      with two cysteines formed an intra-molecular disulfide bridge and C-terminal 
      amidation. cDNA encoding ZDPI precursor was cloned from skin cDNA library of A. 
      loloensis. The precursor is composed of 63 amino acid (aa) residues including the 
      predicted signal peptide (22 aa), an acidic spacer peptide (19 aa), and mature ZDPI. 
      BLAST search indicates that ZDPI belongs to antimicrobial peptide family of 
      ranacyclin, peptide leucine arginine or odorranain. It was found to inhibit 
      ADP-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 
      32 μg/ml, ZDPI completely inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP. To the best 
      of our knowledge, this is the first report about an anti-platelet peptide from 
      amphibian skin secretions. Considering its strong inhibitory ability on platelets 
      and simple structure, ZDPI might be an excellent candidate or template to develop 
      anti-thrombosis agent. In addition, the discovery of anti-platelet peptide in the 
      frog skin increases biological function spectrum of amphibian skin peptides.

TI  - Antimicrobial properties of two purified skin peptides from the mink frog (Rana 
      septentrionalis) against bacteria isolated from the natural habitat.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - Numerous peptides exhibiting antimicrobial properties have been isolated from the 
      skins of many amphibian species. These peptides offer an innate chemical defense 
      system against various microbial agents that exist in the amphibian's environment. 
      Amphibian skin peptides are typically tested for antimicrobial activity against 
      microbial strains that are pathogenic to humans, but not on potential pathogenic or 
      opportunistic bacteria that exist in the organism's habitat. Two peptides, a 
      brevinin-2-related peptide and temporin-1SPb previously isolated from secretions of 
      the mink frog, Rana septentrionalis, were tested for antimicrobial activity on 
      bacterial isolates endemic to the frog's habitat. Ten isolates were identified, 
      using 16S rRNA gene sequencing techniques, in the genera Pseudomonas, Serratia, 
      Bacillus, Aeromonas, Burkholderia, Microbacterium, and Delftia. Bacterial isolates 
      were tested with peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.8 microM to 1000 microM 
      to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to inhibit growth. Growth of 
      four of the isolates was inhibited by temporin-1SPb at the concentrations used, but 
      all of the isolates were inhibited by the brevinin-2-related within the range of 
      peptide concentrations used. This demonstrates the efficacy of both peptides as a 
      component of the frog's innate chemical defense system.

TI  - Insulin-releasing properties of the frog skin peptide pseudin-2 and its 
      [Lys18]-substituted analogue.
PG  - 143-8
LID - 10.1515/BC.2008.018 [doi]
AB  - Abstract Pseudin-2 is a cationic alpha-helical peptide that was first isolated from 
      the skin of the paradoxical frog Pseudis paradoxa on the basis of its antimicrobial 
      activity. We have investigated the insulin-releasing properties and cytotoxicity of 
      the peptide, together with selected analogues with increased cationicity and 
      hydrophobicity. At concentrations in the range 10(-9)-10(-6) m, pseudin-2, and its 
      [Lys18], [Phe8], and [d-Lys3,d-Lys10,d-Lys14] derivatives, stimulated insulin 
      release from the BRIN-BD11 clonal beta-cell line without increasing release of 
      lactate dehydrogenase. The [Lys18] analogue was the most potent (46% increase in 
      insulin release at 10(-9) m) and the most effective (215% increase in insulin 
      release at 10(-6) m). The more cationic [Lys3,Lys10,Lys14] and 
      [Lys3,Lys10,Lys14,Lys21] analogues lacked insulinotropic action and the more 
      hydrophobic [Phe16] analogue was cytotoxic at concentrations > or =10(-7) m. 
      Pseudin-2 and [Lys18]-pseudin-2 had no effect on intracellular calcium 
      concentrations and stimulated insulin release in the absence of external calcium. 
      [Lys18]-pseudin-2 (10(-8) m) stimulated insulin release in the presence of diazoxide 
      and verapamil. Our results demonstrate that pseudin-2 stimulates insulin secretion 
      from BRIN-BD11 cells by a mechanism involving Ca2+-independent pathways and identify 
      [Lys18]-pseudin-2 as a peptide that may have potential for development as a 
      therapeutically valuable insulinotropic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides and alytesin are co-secreted from the venom of the Midwife 
      toad, Alytes maurus (Alytidae, Anura): implications for the evolution of frog skin 
      defensive secretions.

AB  - The skin secretions of frogs and toads (Anura) have long been a known source of a 
      vast abundance of bioactive substances. In the past decade, transcriptome data of 
      the granular glands of anuran skin has given new impetus to investigations of the 
      putative constituent peptides. Alytes obstetricans was recently investigated and 
      novel peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated and functionally 
      characterised. However, genetic data for the evolutionarily ancient lineage to which 
      Alytes belongs (midwife toads; Alytidae) remains unavailable. Here we present the 
      first such genetic data for Alytidae, derived via the granular gland transcriptome 
      of a closely-related species of midwife toad, Alytes maurus. First, we present 
      nucleotide sequences of the entire peptide precursors for four novel antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs). The two precursors resemble those from Bombinatoridae in both their 
      structural architecture and amino acid sequence. Each precursor comprises two AMPs 
      as tandem repeats, with a member of the alyteserin-1 family (alyteserin-1Ma: 
      GFKEVLKADLGSLVKGIAAHVAN-NH2 or alyteserin-1Mb: GFKEVLKAGLGSLVKGIPAHVAN-NH2) followed 
      by its corresponding member from the alyteserin-2 family (alyteserin-2Ma: 
      FIGKLISAASGLLSHL-NH2 or alyteserin-2Mb: ILGAIIPLVSGLLSHL-NH2). Synthetic replicates 
      of the four AMPs possessed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 9.5 
      to 300 μM, with the most potent being alyteserin-2Ma. Second, we also cloned the 
      cDNA encoding an alytesin precursor, with the active alytesin exhibiting high 
      sequence identity to bombesin-related peptides from other frogs. All putative mature 
      peptide sequences were confirmed to be present in the skin secretion via LC/MS. The 
      close structural resemblance of the alyteserin genes that we isolated for A. maurus 
      with those of Bombina provide independent molecular evidence for a close 
      evolutionary relationship between these genera as well as more support for the 
      convergent evolution of the AMP system within anurans. In contrast to the more 
      evolutionarily conserved nature of neuropeptides (including alytesin, which we also 
      isolated), the more variable nature of the AMP system together with the sporadic 
      distribution of AMPs among anuran amphibians fuels in part our hypothesis that the 
      latter system was co-opted secondarily to fulfil a function in the innate immune 
      system, having originally evolved for defence against potential macropredators.

AB  - Caerin is a family of peptides isolated from the glandular secretion of Australian 
      tree frogs, the genus Litoria, and has been previously shown to have anticancer 
      activity against several cancer cells. In this work, we used two host-defence 
      peptides, caerin 1.1 and caerin 1.9, to investigate their ability to inhibit a 
      murine derived TC-1 cell transformed with human papillomavirus 16 E6 and E7 growth 
      in vitro. Caerin 1.9 inhibits TC-1 cell proliferation, although inhibition is more 
      pronounced when applied in conjunction with caerin 1.1. To gain further insights 
      into the antiproliferative mechanisms of caerin 1.9 and its additive effect with 
      caerin 1.1, we used a proteomics strategy to quantitatively examine (i) the changes 
      in the protein profiles of TC-1 cells and (ii) the excretory-secretory products of 
      TC-1 cells following caerin peptides treatment. Caerin 1.9 treatment significantly 
      altered the abundance of several immune-related proteins and related pathways, such 
      as the Tec kinase and ILK signalling pathways, as well as the levels of 
      proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In conclusion, caerin peptides inhibit 
      TC-1 cell proliferation, associated with modification in signalling pathways that 
      would change the tumour microenvironment which is normally immune suppressive.

TI  - Solution NMR structures of the antimicrobial peptides phylloseptin-1, -2, and -3 and 
      biological activity: the role of charges and hydrogen bonding interactions in 
      stabilizing helix conformations.
PG  - 1633-44
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.06.022 [doi]
AB  - Phylloseptins are antimicrobial peptides of 19-20 residues which are found in the 
      skin secretions of the Phyllomedusa frogs that inhabit the tropical forests of South 
      and Central Americas. The peptide sequences of PS-1, -2, and -3 carry an amidated 
      C-terminus and they exhibit 74% sequence homology with major variations of only four 
      residues close to the C-terminus. Here we investigated and compared the structures 
      of the three phylloseptins in detail by CD- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopies 
      in the presence of phospholipid vesicles or in membrane-mimetic environments. Both 
      CD and NMR spectroscopies reveal a high degree of helicity in the order PS-2> or 
      =PS-1>PS-3, where the differences accumulate at the C-terminus. The conformational 
      variations can be explained by taking into consideration electrostatic interactions 
      of the negative ends of the helix dipoles with potentially cationic residues at 
      positions 17 and 18. Whereas two are present in the sequence of PS-1 and -2 only one 
      is present in PS-3. In conclusion, the antimicrobial phylloseptin peptides adopt 
      alpha-helical conformations in membrane environments which are stabilized by 
      electrostatic interactions of the helix dipole as well as other contributions such 
      hydrophobic and capping interactions.

TI  - The ascaphins: a family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the 
      most primitive extant frog, Ascaphus truei.
PG  - 170-5
AB  - The tailed frog Ascaphus truei occupies a unique position in phylogeny as the most 
      primitive extant anuran and is regarded as the sister taxon to the clade of all 
      other living frogs. Eight structurally related peptides, termed ascaphins 1-8, were 
      isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of A. truei and were shown 
      to possess differential growth inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli and 
      Staphylococcus aureus. Ascaphins 2-7 may be represented by the consensus amino acid 
      sequence GX2DX2KGAAKX3KTVAX2IANX.COOH whereas ascaphin-1 
      (GFRDVLKGAAKAFVKTVAGHIAN.NH2) and ascaphin-8 (GFKDLLKGAAKALVKTVLF.NH2) contain a 
      C-terminally alpha-amidated residue. The ascaphins show no appreciable structural 
      similarity with other families of antimicrobial peptides from frog skin but display 
      limited sequence identity with the cationic, amphipathic alpha-helical peptides 
      pandinin 1 and opistoporin 1, isolated from the venoms of African scorpions. 
      Ascaphin-8 shows the highest potency against a range of pathogenic microorganisms 
      but has the greatest haemolytic activity. The data indicate that the host defence 
      strategy of using antimicrobial peptides in skin secretions arose early in the 
      evolution of anurans.

TI  - Insulinotropic actions of the frog skin host-defense peptide alyteserin-2a: a 
      structure-activity study.
PG  - 196-204
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12151 [doi]
AB  - Alyteserin-2a (ILGKLLSTAAGLLSNL.NH2 ) stimulated the rate of insulin release from 
      BRIN-BD11 clonalβ cells at a concentration of 30 nm (p < 0.05) with a response of 
      296 ± 26% of basal release at 3 μm (p < 0.001). The insulinotropic actions of 
      analogs containing substitutions by l-lysine, d-lysine, or l-tryptophan at sites 
      that maintain amphipathicity were evaluated. The [G11K], [S7k], [S7k,G11k], and 
      [G11k,N15K] analogs were the most potent stimulating insulin release at 0.01 nm 
      (p < 0.05). The [S7K], [G11K], [S14K], [N15K], [G11k], and [S7K,G11K] analogs were 
      the most effective producing an approximately twofold greater (p < 0.001) release of 
      insulin at 3 μm compared with alyteserin-2a. The [T8W] and [A9W] analogs were less 
      active than alyteserin-2a. No peptide-stimulated release of lactate dehydrogenase at 
      concentrations up to 3 μm, indicating that the integrity of the plasma membrane had 
      been preserved. Membrane depolarization and an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) 
      concentration are involved in the mechanism of action of the peptides. 
      Administration of [G11k]alyteserin-2a (75 nmol/kg body weight) to high-fat-fed mice 
      with obesity and insulin resistance significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced insulin 
      release and improved glucose tolerance during the 60-min period following an 
      intraperitoneal glucose load.

AB  - It is now well established that peptides that were first identified on the basis of 
      their ability to inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi are multifunctional and so are 
      more informatively described as host-defense peptides. In some cases, their role in 
      protecting the organism against pathogenic microorganisms, although of importance, 
      may be secondary. A previous article in the journal (Peptides 2014; 57:67-77) 
      assessed the potential of peptides present in the skin secretions of frogs for 
      development into anticancer, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antidiabetic drugs. 
      This review aims to extend the scope of this earlier article by focusing upon 
      therapeutic applications of host-defense peptides present in skin secretions and/or 
      skin extracts of species belonging to other vertebrate classes (Agnatha, 
      Elasmobranchii, Teleostei, Reptilia, and Mammalia as represented by the human) that 
      supplement their potential role as anti-infectives for use against 
      multidrug-resistant microorganisms.

TI  - Purification and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions 
      of the carpenter frog Rana virgatipes (Ranidae, Aquarana).
PG  - 38-45
AB  - The members of the Aquarana (or Rana catesbeiana species group) form a 
      well-supported monophyletic clade but phylogenetic relationships between species 
      within the group are incompletely understood. Peptides that differentially inhibited 
      the growth of bacteria were purified from electrically stimulated skin secretions of 
      the carpenter frog Rana virgatipes. Structural characterization identified members 
      of the ranatuerin-2 (3 peptides) and temporin (3-peptides) families, previously 
      found in the skins of R. catesbeiana, R. clamitans, R. grylio and R. 
      septentrionalis. Ranalexin, a peptide previously found only in the Aquarana, was 
      isolated together with a variant (FFGLHNLVPSMLCVVRKKC) that lacks the propensity to 
      adopt an alpha-helical conformation and so was devoid of antimicrobial activity. Two 
      C-terminally alpha-amidated peptides belonging to the brevinin-2 family were 
      isolated from the skin secretions that, like an ortholog from R. septentrionalis, 
      lacked the C-terminal cyclic heptapeptide domain associated with members of this 
      family. Ranatuerin-1, previously isolated from R. catesbeiana, R. clamitans and R. 
      grylio but absent from R. septentrionalis, was also not identified in R. virgatipes. 
      Synthetic replicates of temporin-1Va (FLSSIGKILGNLL.NH2), temporin-IVb 
      (FLSIIAKVLGSLF.NH2) and temporin-1Vc (FLPLVTMLLGKLF.NH2) potently inhibited growth 
      of Gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). 
      Temporin-1Va was also active against Gram-negative bacteria and the opportunistic 
      yeast pathogen Candida albicans and had relatively weak hemolytic activity (LD50=120 
      microM) and may therefore represent a candidate for drug development. Our data 
      support the placement of R. virgatipes in the Aquarana and indicate a closer 
      phylogenetic relationship of R. virgatipes with R. septentrionalis than with R. 
      catesbeiana, R. clamitans and R. grylio.

TI  - Role of C-terminal heptapeptide in pore-forming activity of antimicrobial agent, 
      gaegurin 4.
PG  - 151-8
AB  - Gaegurin 4 (GGN4) is an antimicrobial peptide of 37 amino acids isolated from the 
      skin of a frog, Rana rugosa. GGN4 has a disulfide bond between the residues 31 and 
      37, which is highly conserved among the antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin of 
      the genus, Rana. However, the role of this C-terminal heptapeptide motif is not well 
      understood. In this work, we compared the membrane effects of the full-length GGN4 
      (C37) and GGN4 1-30 (C30), which is devoid of the C-terminal seven amino acids to 
      elucidate the function of the C-terminal motif. C37 induced significantly larger 
      membrane conductance (>10x) in the model lipid bilayers formed with acidic and 
      neutral phospholipids and larger K+ efflux from gram-positive (>30x) and 
      gram-negative bacteria. However, the pores induced by C37 and C30 were not different 
      in their permeability to K+ over Cl- (permeability ratio of K+ to Cl- = 4.8-7.1). In 
      addition, the pore-forming effect of C37 or C30 in acidic membranes was not 
      different from that in neutral membranes. Furthermore, C37-induced K+ efflux was not 
      significantly decreased by the reducing agent, dithiothreitol. The results indicate 
      that C-terminal heptapeptide sequence plays an important role in maintaining the 
      high pore-forming activity of GGN4, but does not participate in forming GGN4-induced 
      pore structure. The disulfide bond in this region does not appear critical for such 
      high ionophoric activity of GGN4.

PG  - 487-91
LID - 10.2108/zsj.25.487 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important components of the host innate defense 
      system against pathogenic microbial invasion in many organisms. In the present 
      study, we cloned by RT-PCR a cDNA from total RNA prepared from the skin of the 
      Japanese brown frog Rana japonica. The cDNA directs the synthesis of a novel, 
      non-C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide composed of 21 amino acid residues 
      (FLGSLIGAAIPAIKQLLGLKK). The putative peptide showed limited sequence similarity to 
      atypical acyclic brevinin-1OK family AMPs originally isolated from the skin of the 
      Ryukyu brown frog (R. okinavana), which lacks the COOH-terminal cyclic domain 
      commonly observed in typical brevinin-1 groups, but that contains a C-terminally 
      alpha-amidated residue. Although it is unclear whether the peptide, designated 
      brevinin-1Ja, is produced in R. japonica skin, a synthetic replicate of the peptide 
      showed differential growth-inhibiting activity against the Gram-positive bacterium 
      Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (minimal 
      inhibitory concentrations: 15 microM and 119 microM, respectively), and produced 
      cell death of mammalian COS7 cells (LD50=28 microM).

TI  - Antimicrobial peptide defenses against pathogens associated with global amphibian 
      declines.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - Global declines of amphibian populations are a source of great concern. Several 
      pathogens that can infect the skin have been implicated in the declines. The 
      pathogen most frequently associated with recent die-offs is a chytrid fungus, 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. A second fungus, Basidiobolus ranarum, was isolated 
      from declining populations of Wyoming toads. A third pathogen, Aeromonas hydrophila, 
      is an opportunistic bacterium found in healthy frogs, but capable of inducing 
      disease. Among the immune defense mechanisms used by amphibians is the production of 
      antimicrobial peptides in granular glands in the skin. These packets of natural 
      antibiotics can be emptied onto the skin when the amphibian is injured. To determine 
      whether antimicrobial skin peptides defend against these amphibian pathogens, six 
      peptides (magainin I, magainin II, PGLa, CPF, ranalexin, and dermaseptin), from 
      three species, and representing three structurally different families of peptides, 
      were tested in growth inhibition assays. We show here that the peptides can kill or 
      inhibit growth of both fungi but not Aeromonas. Although each peptide varied in its 
      effectiveness, at least one from each species was effective against both fungi at a 
      concentration of about 10-20 microM. This is the first direct evidence that 
      antimicrobial peptides in the skin can operate as a first line of defense against 
      the organisms associated with global amphibian declines. It suggests that this 
      innate defense mechanism may play a role in preventing or limiting infection by 
      these organisms.

TI  - Two Novel Dermaseptin-Like Antimicrobial Peptides with Anticancer Activities from 
      the Skin Secretion of Pachymedusa dacnicolor.
LID - 10.3390/toxins8050144 [doi]
LID - 144
AB  - The dermaseptin antimicrobial peptide family contains members of 27-34 amino acids 
      in length that have been predominantly isolated from the skins/skin secretions of 
      phyllomedusine leaf frogs. By use of a degenerate primer in Rapid amplification of 
      cDNA ends (RACE) PCR designed to a common conserved domain within the 
      5'-untranslated regions of previously-characterized dermaseptin encoding cDNAs, two 
      novel members of this peptide family, named dermaseptin-PD-1 and dermaseptin-PD-2, 
      were identified in the skin secretion of the phyllomedusine frog, Pachymedusa 
      dacnicolor. The primary structures of both peptides were predicted from cloned 
      cDNAs, as well as being confirmed by mass spectral analysis of crude skin secretion 
      fractions resulted from reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. 
      Chemically-synthesized replicates of dermaseptin-PD-1 and dermaseptin-PD-2 were 
      investigated for antimicrobial activity using standard model microorganisms 
      (Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and a yeast) and for cytotoxicity 
      using mammalian red blood cells. The possibility of synergistic effects between the 
      two peptides and their anti-cancer cell proliferation activities were assessed. The 
      peptides exhibited moderate to high inhibition against the growth of the tested 
      microorganisms and cancer cell lines with low haemolytic activity. Synergistic 
      interaction between the two peptides in inhibiting the proliferation of Escherichia 
      coli and human neuronal glioblastoma cell line, U251MG was also manifested.

TI  - Probiotics Modulate a Novel Amphibian Skin Defense Peptide That Is Antifungal and 
      Facilitates Growth of Antifungal Bacteria.
PG  - 192-202
LID - 10.1007/s00248-019-01385-9 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics can ameliorate diseases of humans and wildlife, but the mechanisms remain 
      unclear. Host responses to interventions that change their microbiota are largely 
      uncharacterized. We applied a consortium of four natural antifungal bacteria to the 
      skin of endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs, Rana sierrae, before 
      experimental exposure to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). 
      The probiotic microbes did not persist, nor did they protect hosts, and skin peptide 
      sampling indicated immune modulation. We characterized a novel skin defense peptide 
      brevinin-1Ma (FLPILAGLAANLVPKLICSITKKC) that was downregulated by the probiotic 
      treatment. Brevinin-1Ma was tested against a range of amphibian skin cultures and 
      found to inhibit growth of fungal pathogens Bd and B. salamandrivorans, but enhanced 
      the growth of probiotic bacteria including Janthinobacterium lividum, 
      Chryseobacterium ureilyticum, Serratia grimesii, and Pseudomonas sp. While commonly 
      thought of as antimicrobial peptides, here brevinin-1Ma showed promicrobial 
      function, facilitating microbial growth. Thus, skin exposure to probiotic bacterial 
      cultures induced a shift in skin defense peptide profiles that appeared to act as an 
      immune response functioning to regulate the microbiome. In addition to direct 
      microbial antagonism, probiotic-host interactions may be a critical mechanism 
      affecting disease resistance.

      lectin-like peptide (odorranalectin HYba) from the skin secretion of Hydrophylax 
      bahuvistara which is being the shortest lectin-like peptide identified so far from 
      the frog skin secretion, with 15 amino acid residues. The peptide is the first 
      report from an Indian frog and lacks antimicrobial activity but strongly agglutinate 
      intact human erythrocytes. The sequences at the L-fucose recognizing region is 
      conserved as in other lectins reported from frog skin secretion and could be 
      exploited for specificity and drug targeting properties.

AB  - A series of linear and cyclic fragments and analogs of two peptides (OGTI and 
      HV-BBI) isolated from skin secretions of frogs were synthesized by the solid-phase 
      method. Their inhibitory activity against several serine proteinases: bovine 
      β-trypsin, bovine α-chymotypsin, human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G from human 
      neutrophils, was investigated together with evaluation of their antimicrobial 
      activities against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive 
      species isolated from patients (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, 
      Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp.). The cytotoxicity of the selected peptides 
      toward an immortal human skin fibroblast cell line was also determined. Three 
      peptides: HV-BBI, its truncated fragment HV-BBI(3-18) and its analog [Phe(8)]HV-BBI 
      can be considered as bifunctional compounds with inhibitory as well as antibacterial 
      properties. OGTI, although it did not display trypsin inhibitory activity as 
      previously reported in the literature, exerted antimicrobial activity toward S. 
      epidermidis. In addition, under our experimental conditions, this peptide did not 
      show cytotoxicity.

AB  - Amphibian skin secretions are established sources of bioactive peptides. Here we 
      describe the isolation, structural and pharmacological characterisation of a novel 
      vasoconstrictor peptide from the skin secretion of the African hyperoliid frog, 
      Kassina maculata, which exhibits no structural similarity to any known class of 
      amphibian skin peptide. The peptide consists of 21 amino acid residues, 
      FIKELLPHLSGIIDSVANAIK, and is C-terminally amidated. The provisional structure was 
      obtained by MS/MS fragmentation using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and L/I 
      ambiguities were resolved following molecular cloning of biosynthetic 
      precursor-encoding cDNA. A synthetic replicate of the peptide was found to possess 
      weak antimicrobial and haemolytic activities but was exceptionally effective in 
      constricting the smooth muscle of rat tail artery (EC(50) of 25 pM). In reflection 
      of its exceptional potency in constricting rat arterial smooth muscle, the peptide 
      was named kasstasin, a derivation of Kassina and "stasis" (stoppage of flow). These 
      data illustrate the continuing potential of amphibian skin secretions to provide 
      novel natural peptide templates for biological evaluation.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the Tsushima brown frog Rana tsushimensis.
PG  - 42-9
AB  - The Tsushima brown frog Rana tsushimensis Stejneger, 1907 exists in reproductive 
      isolation on the island of Tsushima, Japan. Six peptides with antimicrobial activity 
      were isolated in pure form from an extract of the skin of this species and their 
      amino acid sequences identified them as members of the brevinin-1 (one peptide), 
      brevinin-2 (one peptide) and temporin (four peptides) families. The C-terminally 
      alpha-amidated brevinin-1 peptide (FLGSIVGALASALPSLISKIRN.NH2) lacks the cyclic 
      heptapeptide domain Cys18-(Xaa)4-Lys-Cys24 at the COOH-terminus of the molecule that 
      characterizes other members of that family. A structurally similar brevinin-1 
      peptide, also lacking the cyclic domain, was previously isolated from the skin of 
      the Ryukyu brown frog Rana okinavana, indicative of a close phylogenetic 
      relationship between the species. Brevinin-2TSa (GIMSLFKGVLKTAGKHVAGSLVDQLKCKITGGC) 
      showed broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against a range of Gram-negative 
      and Gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) 
      (minimum inhibitory concentrations< or =25 microM) and relatively low hemolytic 
      activity against human erythrocytes (LD50=100 microM). The peptide therefore 
      represents a candidate for drug development.

TI  - An atypical member of the brevinin-1 family of antimicrobial peptides isolated from 
      the skin of the European frog Rana dalmatina.
PG  - 191-6
AB  - A single peptide with antimicrobial activity was extracted from the skin of the 
      European agile frog (R. dalmatina). The primary structure of this 17 
      amino-acid-residue peptide (ILPLLLGKVVCAITKKC) does not immediately suggest 
      membership of any of the previously described families of antimicrobial peptides 
      from ranid frogs. However, if it is assumed that the peptide has undergone several 
      residue deletions during the course of speciation, it shows sequence similarity with 
      peptides belonging to the widely distributed brevinin-1 family, particularly those 
      isolated from the related species Rana temporaria. The minimum inhibitory 
      concentration of the peptide, termed brevinin-1 Da, against the Gram-positive 
      bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was 7 microM and against the Gram-negative bacterium 
      Escherichia coli was 30 microM.

TI  - Antimicrobial Peptides from Amphibian Innate Immune System as Potent Antidiabetic 
      Agents: A Literature Review and Bioinformatics Analysis.

LID - 2894722
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides, as an important member of the innate immune system, have 
      various biological activities in addition to antimicrobial activity. There are some 
      AMPs with antidiabetic activity, especially those isolated from amphibians. These 
      peptides can induce insulin release via different mechanisms based on peptide type. 
      In this review study, we collected all reported AMPs with antidiabetic activity. We 
      also analyze the sequence and structure of these peptides for evaluation of sequence 
      and structure effect on their antidiabetic activity. Based on this review, the 
      biggest peptide family with antidiabetic activity is temporins with nine 
      antidiabetic peptides. Frogs are the most abundant source of antidiabetic peptides. 
      Bioinformatics analysis showed that an increase of positive net charge and a 
      decrease of hydrophobicity can improve the insulinotropic effect of peptides. 
      Peptides with higher positive net charge and Boman index showed higher activity. 
      Based on this review article, AMPs with antidiabetic activity, especially those 
      isolated from amphibians, can be used as novel antidiabetic drug for type 2 diabetes 
      disease. So, amphibians are potential sources for active peptides which merit 
      further evaluation as novel insulin secretagogues. However, strategy for the 
      increase of stability and positive activity as well as the decrease of negative side 
      effects must be considered.

TI  - A mini review on the antimicrobial peptides isolated from the genus Hylarana 
      (Amphibia: Anura) with a proposed nomenclature for amphibian skin peptides.
PG  - 6943-7
LID - 10.1007/s11033-012-1521-3 [doi]
AB  - Hylarana is a well established frog genus coming under the family Ranidae. An 
      increasing number of antimicrobial peptides have been isolated and characterized 
      from the skin of frogs of this genus. This review covers the antimicrobial peptides 
      reported so far from the frogs of Hylarana genus and to propose a consistent system 
      of nomenclature for amphibian skin peptides. Multiple sequence alignment of the skin 
      peptides from Hylarana genus has grouped them into six peptide families, and three 
      bioactive peptides. Existing nomenclature of amphibian antimicrobial peptides is 
      species centered with no implication to the genus which can lead to disparities, 
      when frogs with same species name belonging to different genus have to be named. As 
      per the proposed system the peptide should have the parent peptide name (e.g. 
      Brevinin-1) followed by two uppercase letter of the genus, if two genera begin with 
      the same letter-first letter should be the same followed by an appropriate second 
      letter (e.g. HU for Huia and HM for Humenerana). This is succeeded by species name 
      in lower case-orthologous peptides from different species may be characterized by 
      the initial letter of that species, when two species begin with the same initial 
      letter, second letter should be used appropriately (e.g. HLat for Hylarana aurata 
      and HLan for Hylarana aurantiaca). Paralogs belonging to the same peptide family are 
      assigned by numbers.

AB  - Broad-folded frogs (Hylarana latouchii), one member of 12 species of the genus 
      Hylarana in the Chinese frog fauna, are widely distributed in the South of China. In 
      this study, we purified and characterized three antimicrobial peptides from the skin 
      secretion of H. latouchii. Five different cDNA fragments encoding the precursors of 
      these antimicrobial peptides were cloned, and five mature antimicrobial peptides 
      belonging to two different families were deduced from the five cDNAs. Structural 
      characterization of the mature peptides had identified them as members of the 
      brevinin-1 and temporin families. They were named brevinin-1LTa 
      (FFGTALKIAANVLPTAICKILKKC), brevinin-1LTb (FFGTALKIAANILPTAICKILKKC), temporin-LTa 
      (FFPLVLGALGSILPKIF-NH(2)), temporin-LTb (FIITGLVRGLTKLF-NH(2)) and temorin-LTc 
      (SLSRFLSFLKIVYPPAF-NH(2)). Brevinin-1LTa, temporin-LTa, temporin-LTb and 
      temporin-LTc with different antimicrobial activities induced significant 
      morphological alterations of the tested microbial surfaces as shown by scanning 
      electron microscopy, which indicated strong membrane disruption.

TI  - A family of antimicrobial peptides related to japonicin-2 isolated from the skin of 
      the chaochiao brown frog Rana chaochiaoensis.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Four structurally-related peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from an 
      extract of the skin of the Chinese brown frog, Rana chaochiaoensis Liu, 1946. 
      Determination of their primary structures revealed that they are members of the 
      japonicin-2 family, previously identified only in the skin of the Japanese brown 
      frog, R. japonica. Japonicin-2CHa (FVLPLLGILPKELCIVLKKNC) represented the most 
      abundant peptide in the extract but its growth-inhibitory potency against 
      Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC=100 microM) and 
      Escherichia coli (MIC>100 microM) was appreciably less than that of the more 
      cationic japonicin-2 (FGLPMLSILPKALCILLKRKC). The high degree of structural 
      similarity of japonicin-2CHb (VVPAFVLLKKAICIMLKRNC) with japonicin-2CHc (K9 --> R), 
      and japonicin-2CHd (L16 --> F) is suggestive of recent gene duplication events. The 
      data indicate a close phylogenetic relationship between R. chaochiaoensis and R. 
      japonica but demonstrate that the species are not conspecific.

TI  - Hainanenins: a novel family of antimicrobial peptides with strong activity from 
      Hainan cascade-frog, Amolops hainanensis.
PG  - 251-7
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2012.01.014 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) secreted by amphibian skin represent an important 
      innate immune defense strategy. There are more than 340 species in the family of 
      Ranidae worldwidely, and from which nearly 100 families of AMPs comprising between 8 
      and 48 amino acid (aa) residues have been characterized. In current work, two novel 
      AMPs were purified from the skin secretion of Hainan cascade-frog, Amolops 
      hainanensis, and 31 cDNA sequences encoding 10 novel AMPs belonging to 4 families 
      were cloned from the constructed skin cDNA library of A. hainanensis. Among these 10 
      AMPs, 5 peptides represent the prototypes of a novel amphibian AMP family. According 
      to the generic name of the species of origin, they were designated as 
      hainanenin-1-5. Each of them consists of 21 aa residues with a C-terminal disulphide 
      loop of 7 residues between Cys(15) and Cys(21). Two of them (hainanenin-1 and 5) 
      were then synthesized and their in vitro activities were screened, including 
      antimicrobial, hemolytic and antioxidant activities. The results showed that 
      hainanenin-1 and 5 possessed strong and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities 
      against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, including a large number of 
      clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, and slight antioxidant 
      activity. Undesirably, hainanenin-1 and 5 exhibited strong hemolytic activity on 
      human erythrocytes. The discovery of hainanenins and their great antimicrobial 
      potency provides new templates for anti-infective agent design.

PG  - 53-60
AB  - Eight peptides with differential growth-inhibitory activity against the 
      gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, the gram-negative bacterium 
      Escherichia coli and the yeast, Candida albicans were isolated from an extract of 
      the skin of the North American pig frog Rana grylio. The primary structures of these 
      antimicrobial peptides were different from previously characterized antimicrobial 
      peptides from Ranid frogs but on the basis of sequence similarities, the peptides 
      may be classified as belonged to four previously characterized peptide families: the 
      ranatuerin-1, ranatuerin-2 and ranalexin families, first identified in the North 
      American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, and the temporin family first identified in the 
      European common frog Rana temporaria. Peptides belonging to the brevinin-1, 
      brevinin-2, esculentin-1, and esculentin-2 families, previously isolated from the 
      skins of other species of Ranid frogs, were not identified in the extracts. The 
      ranatuerin-1 and ranalexin peptides showed broadest spectrum of antimicrobial 
      activity whereas the temporins were active only against S. aureus. Synthetic 
      replicates of temporin-1Gb (SILPTIVSFLSKFL.NH(2)) and temporin-1Gd 
      (FILPLIASFLSKFL.NH(2)) produced concentration-dependent relaxation of preconstricted 
      vascular rings from the rat thoracic aorta (EC(50) = 2.4+/-0.1 microM for 
      temporin-1Gb and 2.3+/-0.2 microM for temporin-1Gd). The antimicrobial peptides that 
      were isolated in extracts of the skin R. grylio were present in the same molecular 
      forms in electrically-stimulated skin secretions of the animal demonstrating that 
      the peptides are stored in the granular glands of the skin in their fully processed 
      forms.

TI  - A novel bradykinin-like peptide from skin secretions of rufous-spotted torrent frog, 
      Amolops loloensis.
PG  - 2683-7
AB  - A bradykinin-like peptide has been isolated from skin secretions of rufous-spotted 
      torrent frog, Amolops loloensis. This bradykinin-like peptide was named amolopkinin. 
      Its primary structure, RAPVPPGFTPFR, was determined by Edman degradation and mass 
      spectrometry. It is structurally related to bradykinin-like peptides identified from 
      skin secretions of other amphibians. Amolopkinin is composed of 12 amino acid 
      residues and is related to bradykinin composed of nine amino acid residues, 
      identified from the skin secretions of Odorrana schmackeri. Amolopkinin was found to 
      elicit concentration-dependent contractile effects on isolated guinea pig ileum. 
      cDNA clones encoding the precursor of amolopkinin were isolated by screening a skin 
      cDNA library of A. loloensis and then sequenced. The amino acid sequences deduced 
      from the cDNA sequences match well with the results from Edman degradation. Analysis 
      of different amphibian bradykinin cDNA structures revealed that a deficiency of 
      an18-nucleotide fragment (TCAAGAATGATCAGACGC in the cDNA encoding bradykinin from O. 
      schmackeri) in the peptide-coding region resulted in absence of a di-basic site for 
      trypsin-like proteinases and an unusual - APV - insertion in the N-terminal part of 
      amolopkinin. This is the first report of a bradykinin-like peptide comprised of 
      bradykinin with an insertion in its N-terminal part. Our results demonstrate the 
      hypervariability of amphibian bradykinin-like peptides, as well as the diversity of 
      antimicrobial peptides in amphibians.

TI  - Characterization of unique amphipathic antimicrobial peptides from venom of the 
      scorpion Pandinus imperator.
PG  - 35-45
AB  - Two novel antimicrobial peptides have been identified and characterized from venom 
      of the African scorpion Pandinus imperator. The peptides, designated pandinin 1 and 
      2, are alpha-helical polycationic peptides, with pandinin 1 belonging to the group 
      of antibacterial peptides previously described from scorpions, frogs and insects, 
      and pandinin 2 to the group of short magainin-type helical peptides from frogs. Both 
      peptides demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against a range of Gram-positive 
      bacteria (2.4-5.2 microM), but were less active against Gram-negative bacteria 
      (2.4-38.2 microM), and only pandinin 2 affected the yeast Candida albicans. Pandinin 
      2 also demonstrated strong haemolytic activity (11.1-44.5 microM) against sheep 
      erythrocytes, in contrast with pandinin 1, which was not haemolytic. CD studies and 
      a high-resolution structure of pandinin 2 determined by NMR, showed that the two 
      peptides are both essentially helical, but differ in their overall structure. 
      Pandinin 2 is composed of a single alpha-helix with a predominantly hydrophobic 
      N-terminal sequence, whereas pandinin 1 consists of two distinct alpha-helices 
      separated by a coil region of higher flexibility. This is the first report of 
      magainin-type polycationic antimicrobial peptides in scorpion venom. Their presence 
      brings new insights into the mode of action of scorpion venom and also opens new 
      avenues for the discovery of novel antibiotic molecules from arthropod venoms.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of gene-encoded small peptides that play 
      pivotal roles in the host immune system of multicellular organisms. Cathelicidins 
      are an important family of AMPs that exclusively exist in vertebrates. Many 
      cathelicidins have been identified from mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. To date, 
      however, cathelicidins from amphibians are poorly understood. In the present study, 
      two novel cathelicidins (OL-CATH1 and 2) were identified and studied from the 
      odorous frog Odorrana livida. Firstly, the cDNAs encoding the OL-CATHs (780 and 735 
      bp in length, respectively) were successfully cloned from a lung cDNA library 
      constructed for the frog. Multi-sequence alignment was carried out to analyze 
      differences between the precursors of the OL-CATHs and other representative 
      cathelicidins. Mature peptide sequences of OL-CATH1 and 2 were predicted (33 amino 
      acid residues) and their secondary structures were determined (OL-CATH1 showed a 
      random-coil conformation and OL-CATH2 demonstrated a-helical conformation). 
      Furthermore, OL-CATH1 and 2 were chemically synthesized and their in vitro functions 
      were determined. Antimicrobial and bacterial killing kinetic analyses indicated that 
      OL-CATH2 demonstrated relatively moderate and rapid antimicrobial potency and 
      exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activity. At very low concentrations (10 μg/mL), 
      OL-CATH2 significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription 
      and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 in mouse 
      peritoneal macrophages. In contrast, OL-CATH1 did not exhibit any detectable 
      antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activities. Overall, identification of these 
      OL-CATHs from O. livida enriches our understanding of the functions of cathelicidins 
      in the amphibian immune system. The potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory 
      activities of OL-CATH2 highlight its potential as a novel candidate in 
      anti-infective drug development.

AB  - The primary structures of host-defense peptides have proved useful in elucidating 
      the evolution history of frogs. Peptidomic analysis was used to compare the 
      diversity of host-defense peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from 
      the octoploid frogs, Xenopus vestitus (Kivu clawed frog) and Xenopus wittei (De 
      Witte's clawed frog) in the family Pipidae. Structural characterization demonstrated 
      that the X. vestitus peptides belong to the magainin (3 peptides), peptide 
      glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa; 4 peptides), xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF; 1 
      peptide), and caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF; 5 peptides) families. The X. wittei 
      peptides comprise magainin (4 peptides), PGLa (1 peptide), XPF (2 peptides), and CPF 
      (7 peptides). In addition, secretions from both species contain caerulein, identical 
      to the peptide from Xenopus laevis, but X. wittei secretions contains the novel 
      peptide [R4K]xenopsin. The variability in the numbers of paralogs in each peptide 
      family indicates a selective silencing of the host-defense peptide genes following 
      the polyploidization events. The primary structures of the peptides provide insight 
      into phylogenetic relationships among the octoploid Xenopus frogs. The data support 
      a sister-group relationship between X. vestitus and Xenopus lenduensis, suggestive 
      of bifurcating speciation after allopolyploidization, whereas X. wittei is more 
      closely related to the Xenopus amieti-Xenopus andrei group suggesting a common 
      tetraploid ancestor. Consistent with previous data, the CPF peptides showed the 
      highest growth inhibitory activity against bacteria with CPF-W6 
      (GIGSLLAKAAKLAAGLV.NH2) combining high antimicrobial potency against Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MIC=4 μM) with relatively low hemolytic activity (LC50=190 μM).

AB  - Amphibians exhibit various, characteristic adaptations related to their "incomplete" 
      shift from the aquatic to the terrestrial habitat. In particular, the integument was 
      subject to a number of specialized modifications during the evolution of these 
      animals. In this review, we place special emphasis on endogenous host-defence skin 
      peptides from the cuteanous granular glands anuran amphibians (frogs and toads). The 
      overview on the two broad groups of neuroactive and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      goes beyond a simple itemization in that we provide a new perspective into the 
      evolution and function of anuran AMPs. Briefly, these cationic, amphipathic and 
      α-helical peptides are traditionally viewed as being part of the innate immune 
      system, protecting the moist skin against invading microorganisms through their 
      cytolytic action. However, the complete record of anuran species investigated to 
      date suggests that AMPs are distributed sporadically (i.e., non-universally) across 
      Anura. Together with the intriguing observation that virtually all anurans known to 
      produce neuropeptides in their granular glands also co-secrete cytolytic peptides, 
      we call the traditional role for AMPs as being purely antimicrobial into question 
      and present an alternative scenario. We hypothesize AMPs to assist neuroactive 
      peptides in their antipredator role through their cytolytic action increasing the 
      delivery of the latter to the endocrine and nervous system of the predator. Thus, 
      AMPs are more accurately viewed as cytolysins and their contribution to the immune 
      system is better regarded as an accessory benefit.

      bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus.
PG  - 301-5
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpc.2010.05.005 [doi]
AB  - The Harderian gland is an orbital gland found in many tetrapod species that possess 
      a nictitating membrane. While the main role of the Harderian gland is lubrication of 
      the eyeballs, numerous other functions are attributed to this gland. In amphibians, 
      mast cells have been detected in the Harderian gland, suggesting that the gland is 
      involved in the host's system of innate immunity defending against microbial 
      invasions. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we cloned from the 
      bullfrog Harderian gland total RNA preparations, cDNAs encoding biosynthetic 
      precursors for the antimicrobial peptides temporin-CBa (FLPIASLLGKYL-NH2), 
      previously isolated from an extract of bullfrog skin, and chensirin-2CBa 
      (IIPLPLGYFAKKP) that contained the amino acid substitution Thr13-->Pro compared with 
      chensirin-2 from the Chinese brown frog, Rana chensinensis. By means of in situ 
      hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes for preprotemporin-CBa and 
      preprochensirin-2CBa, we have demonstrated for the first time in an amphibian the 
      presence of mRNAs encoding these two precursors in the cytoplasm of the glandular 
      cells in the bullfrog Harderian gland.

TI  - Temporins, anti-infective peptides with expanding properties.
PG  - 1060-9
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are effector molecules of the innate immune response of all 
      pluricellular organisms, providing them with first-line defence against pathogens. 
      Amphibian skin secretions represent one of the richest natural sources for such 
      peptide antibiotics, and temporins, a large family of antimicrobial peptides from 
      frog skin, are among the smallest ones found in nature to date. Their functional 
      role and modes of action have been described, along with their interesting and 
      unique properties. These properties make temporins good molecules for an in-depth 
      understanding of host defence peptides in general. Furthermore, they are attractive 
      templates for the future design of new therapeutics against infectious diseases with 
      new modes of action, urgently needed due to the increasing resistance of 
      microorganisms to the available drugs.

      and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively, in an infectious challenge model. Frog 
      skin and skin secretions were collected and protein expression in infected frogs 
      compared to control frogs by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, silver staining, 
      and image analysis. Proteins that demonstrated differential expression were analysed 
      by mass spectrometry and identified by searching protein databases. More than 180 
      protein spots demonstrated differential expression in E. coli- or S. 
      aureus-challenged groups and, of these, more than 55 spots were up- or 
      down-regulated at least sixfold, post-infection. Proteins with a potential function 
      in the immune response were identified, such as stathmin 1a, annexin A1, superoxide 
      dismutase A, C-type lectin, lysozyme, antimicrobial peptides, cofilin-1-B, mannose 
      receptor, histone H4, prohormone convertase 1, carbonyl reductase 1 and some 
      components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathway. These molecules are 
      potential candidates for further investigation of immune mechanisms in R. dybowskii; 
      in particular, TLR-mediated responses, which might be activated in frogs exposed to 
      pathogenic bacteria as part of innate immune defence, but which might also impact on 
      adaptive immunity to infection.

TI  - Melanocortin 4 receptors interact with antimicrobial frog peptide analogues.
PG  - 1094-100
AB  - We have developed fluorescence polarization (FP) assays of human melanocortin 4 
      receptor (MC4R) in 384-well microtiter plates using TAMRA-NDP-MSH as a tracer. The 
      rank order of potency of agonists and antagonists agrees well relative to the 
      published assays: SHU9119>MTII>NDP alphaMSH>alphaMSH. We have screened libraries of 
      Korean plant extracts and frog peptide analogues in search of MC4R ligands using FP 
      assays and cell-based CRE luciferase reporter assays. We report that FLGFLFKVASK, 
      FLGWLFKVASK, FLGALFKWASK, and FLGWLFKWASK are the peptide analogues, which bind to 
      human MC4R receptor with good affinity in vitro. FLGWLFKVASK and FLGWLFKWASK 
      stimulated CRE-driven reporter gene via MC4R. In luciferase reporter assays, they 
      possess the pharmacological and functional profiles of full agonists. We demonstrate 
      the interaction of MC4R with 11-residue antimicrobial peptides derived from the 
      Korean frog, Rana rugosa. The results suggest that MC4R interacts promiscuously with 
      bioactive analogues of antimicrobial peptide, gaegurin-5.

TI  - Peptidomic analysis of skin secretions from Rana heckscheri and Rana okaloosae 
      provides insight into phylogenetic relationships among frogs of the Aquarana species 
      group.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - The members of the Aquarana (or Rana catesbeiana species group) form a monophyletic 
      group comprising seven species: R. catesbeiana, Rana clamitans, Rana grylio, Rana 
      virgatipes, Rana septentrionalis, Rana heckscheri and Rana okaloosae. Previous work 
      has led to structural characterization of the antimicrobial peptides present in 
      electrically-stimulated skin secretions from the first five species listed and this 
      study presents the primary structures of orthologs from the river frog R. heckscheri 
      and the Florida bog frog R. okaloosae. Peptidomic analysis of R. heckscheri and R. 
      okaloosae skin secretions led to the identification of peptides with antimicrobial 
      activity belonging to the ranalexin, ranatuerin-2, and temporin families. In 
      addition, a peptide (GFLDIIKDTGKDFAVKILNNLKCKLAGGCPR) was isolated from R. okaloosae 
      whose primary structure identified it as a member of the palustrin-2 family. 
      Consistent with previous data based upon morphological analysis and comparisons of 
      the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, cladistic analysis 
      based upon a comparison of the amino acid sequences of antimicrobial peptides 
      indicates a sister-group relationship between R. heckscheri and R. grylio and a 
      close, but less well defined, phylogenetic relationship between R. okaloosae and R. 
      clamitans.

AB  - Ten peptides with differential growth-inhibitory activity against the gram-positive 
      bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, the gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, and 
      the yeast Candida albicans were isolated from an extract of the skin of a North 
      American frog, the green frog Rana clamitans. Ranatuerin-1C 
      (SMLSVLKNLGKVGLGLVACKINKQC), ranalexin-1Ca (FLGGLMKAFPALICAVTKKC), ranalexin-1Cb 
      (FLGGLMKAFPAIICAVTKKC), ranatuerin-2Ca (GLFLDTLKGAAKDVAGKLLEGLKCKIAGC KP), and 
      ranatuerin-2Cb (GLFLDTLKGLAGKLLQGLKCIKAGCKP), are members of three previously 
      characterized families of antimicrobial peptides, first identified in the North 
      American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. In addition, five structurally related peptides 
      (temporin-1Ca, -1Cb, -1Cc, -1Cd, and -1Ce), comprising 13 amino acid residues and 
      containing a C-terminally alpha-amidated residue, belong to the temporin family 
      first identified in the European common frog Rana temporaria. Peptides belonging to 
      the brevinin-1, brevinin-2, esculentin-1, and esculentin-2 families, previously 
      isolated from the skins of Asian and European Ranid frogs, were not identified in 
      the extract. The data support the hypothesis that the distribution and amino acid 
      sequences of the skin antimicrobial peptides are valuable tools in the 
      identification and classification of Ranid frogs.

TI  - Phylloseptin-PBa1, -PBa2, -PBa3: Three novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin 
      secretion of Burmeister's leaf frog (Phyllomedusa burmeisteri).

AB  - Skin secretions are known as a highly-complex mixture of abundant and diverse 
      bioactive molecules and its study has attracted increasing attention over recent 
      years. Phylloseptin is a unique family of antimicrobial peptides which have been 
      only isolated from frogs of the Phyllomedusinae subfamily. Here, three novel peptide 
      precursors were successfully cloned from a cDNA library, which was constructed from 
      the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa burmeisteri, as pair of primers (one nested 
      universal primer and a designed degenerate sense primer) were employed for "shotgun" 
      cloning. The encoded mature peptides were validated by MS/MS sequencing, and 
      subsequently termed as Phylloseptin-PBa1, -PBa2 and -PBa3. Phylloseptin-PBa1 and 
      -PBa2 were demonstrated to possess potent antimicrobial activities against 
      Gram-positive bacteria and yeast, as well as broad-spectrum anticancer activities, 
      while they possess varying haemolytic activity at the effective concentration. In 
      contrast, Phylloseptin-PBa3 was found to exhibit a strong haemolytic activity even 
      though it was only found to possess a weak antimicrobial activity and inconspicuous 
      anticancer activity.

AB  - Cationic peptides that adopt an amphipathic α-helical conformation in a 
      membrane-mimetic environment are synthesized in the skins of many frog species. 
      These peptides often display cytolytic activities against bacteria and fungi 
      consistent with the idea that they play a role in the host's system of defense 
      against pathogenic microorganisms, but their importance in the survival strategy of 
      the animal is not clearly understood. Despite the common misconception that 
      antimicrobial peptides are synthesized in the skins of all anurans, the species 
      distribution is sporadic, suggesting that their production may confer some 
      evolutionary advantage to the organism but is not necessary for survival. The low 
      potency of many frog skin antimicrobial peptides is consistent with the hypothesis 
      that cutaneous symbiotic bacteria may provide the major system of defense against 
      pathogenic microorganisms in the environment with antimicrobial peptides assuming a 
      supplementary role in some species.

TI  - Naturally Occurring Peptides from Rana temporaria: Antimicrobial Properties and 
      More.
PG  - 54-64
AB  - The extensive search for alternative therapeutics against microbial pathogens has 
      led to the discovery of cationic peptides as new anti-infectives with a novel mode 
      of action. Particular interest has been devoted to small linear peptides that can be 
      efficiently made by chemical synthesis at competitive costs. The most promising 
      originate from a large family of short, naturally occurring peptides found in the 
      skin of amphibia of Rana genus, i.e. the temporins. This review is mainly focused on 
      the recent structure-function studies of the earliest known temporin isoforms (TA, 
      TB and TL) and their potential clinical role as novel antimicrobial agents. The 
      development of novel antibiotics is an urgent public health concern due to the 
      increased resistance of microorganisms to conventional antibiotics, particularly in 
      the hospital setting.

TI  - Host-defence peptides of Australian anurans: structure, mechanism of action and 
      evolutionary significance.
PG  - 1035-54
AB  - Host-defence peptides secreted from the skin glands of Australian frogs and toads, 
      are, with a few notable exceptions, different from those produced by anurans 
      elsewhere. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the following classes of 
      peptide isolated and characterized from Australian anurans: neuropeptides (including 
      smooth muscle active peptides, and peptides that inhibit the production of nitric 
      oxide from neuronal nitric oxide synthase), antimicrobial and anticancer active 
      peptides, antifungal peptides and antimalarial peptides. Other topics covered 
      include sex pheromones of anurans, and the application of peptide profiling to (i). 
      recognize particular populations of anurans of the same species and to differentiate 
      between species, and (ii). investigate evolutionary aspects of peptide formation.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from diverse families isolated from the skin of the Asian 
      frog, Rana grahami.
PG  - 2111-7
AB  - Seven peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated in pure form from an 
      extract of the skin of the Yunnanfu Kunming frog Rana grahami Boulenger, 1917. The 
      peptides were identified as belonging to the nigrocin-2 (three peptides), brevinin-1 
      (one peptide), brevinin-2 (three peptides), and esculentin-1 (one peptide) families. 
      Nigrocin-2GRb (GLFGKILGVGKKVLCGLSGMC) containing three lysine residues, represented 
      the peptide with highest potency against microorganisms (MIC = 3 microM against 
      Escherichia coli, 12.5 microM against Staphylococcus aureus and 50 microM against 
      Candida albicans) and the greatest hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes 
      (LD50 = 40 microM). In contrast, nigrocin-2GRa (GLLSGILGAGKHIVCGLSGLC) and 
      nigrocin-2GRc (GLLSGILGAGKNIVCGLSGLC), with only a single lysine residue, showed 
      weak antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. Phylogenetic relationships among Eurasian 
      ranid frogs are less well understood than those of North American ranids but the 
      primary structures of the R. grahami antimicrobial peptides suggest a close 
      relationship of this species with the Japanese pond frogs R. nigromaculata and R. 
      porosa brevipoda.

TI  - Balancing selection at a frog antimicrobial peptide locus: fluctuating immune 
      effector alleles?
PG  - 2669-80
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msn208 [doi]
AB  - Balancing selection is common on many defense genes, but it has rarely been reported 
      for immune effector proteins such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We describe 
      genetic diversity at a brevinin-1 AMP locus in three species of leopard frogs (Rana 
      pipiens, Rana blairi, and Rana palustris). Several highly divergent allelic lineages 
      are segregating at this locus. That this unusual pattern results from balancing 
      selection is demonstrated by multiple lines of evidence, including a ratio of 
      nonsynonymous/synonymous polymorphism significantly higher than 1, the ZnS test, 
      incongruence between the number of segregating sites and haplotype diversity, and 
      significant Tajima's D values. Our data are more consistent with a model of 
      fluctuating selection in which alleles change frequencies over time than with a 
      model of stable balancing selection such as overdominance. Evidence for fluctuating 
      selection includes skewed allele frequencies, low levels of synonymous variation, 
      nonneutral values of Tajima's D within allelic lineages, an inverse relationship 
      between the frequency of an allelic lineage and its degree of polymorphism, and 
      divergent allele frequencies among populations. AMP loci could be important sites of 
      adaptive genetic diversity, with consequences for host-pathogen coevolution and the 
      ability of species to resist disease epidemics.

TI  - Histamine-releasing and antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the dusky 
      gopher frog, Rana sevosa.
PG  - 1313-9
AB  - Seven novel peptides were isolated from the skin secretions of the North American 
      dusky gopher frog, Rana sevosa, on the basis of antimicrobial activity and histamine 
      release from rat peritoneal mast cells. The peptides were purified to homogeneity 
      using HPLC and characterized by electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry, MALDI-TOF 
      mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of primary structures 
      revealed that the novel peptides could be assigned to four established families of 
      ranid frog antimicrobial peptides, namely esculentin-1, esculentin-2, brevinin-1 and 
      ranatuerin-2. The peptides were named in accordance with accepted terminology as 
      ranatuerin 2SEa, etc., reflecting the peptide family name, the species of origin (SE 
      for sevosa) and the isotype (a). Of major interest was the fact that brevinin 1SE 
      displayed significant structural similarity to ponericin W5, an antibacterial venom 
      peptide from the ant, Pachyconyla goeldii. This is a further example of amphibian 
      skin defensive peptides showing striking structural similarities to peptides from 
      insects. These data may shed some light on the functional biological relevance of 
      defensive peptides that possess both antimicrobial and histamine-releasing 
      activities.

LID - 10.1002/psc.1309 [doi]
AB  - Two novel antimicrobial peptides with similarity to brevinin-2 family are purified 
      and characterized from the skin secretions of the frog, Rana nigrovittata. Their 
      amino acid sequences were determined as GAFGNFLKGVAKKAGLKILSIAQCKLSGTC 
      (brevinin-2-RN1) and GAFGNFLKGVAKKAGLKILSIAQCKLFGTC (brevinin-2-RN2), respectively, 
      by Edman degradation. Different from brevinin-2, which is composed of 33 amino acid 
      residues (aa), both brevinin-2-RN1 and -RN2 contain 30 aa. Five cDNA sequences 
      (Genbank accession numbers, EU136465-9) encoding precursors of brevinin-2-RN1 and 
      -RN2 were screened from the skin cDNA library of R. nigrovittata. These precursors 
      are composed of 72 aa including a predicted signal peptide, an acidic spacer 
      peptide, and a mature brevinin-2-RN. Both brevinin-2-RN1 and -RN2 showed strong 
      antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi. 
      The current work identified and characterized two novel antimicrobial peptides with 
      unique primary structure.

AB  - Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from the Caribbean 
      frog Leptodactylus validus Garman, 1888 led to the identification of three peptides 
      with previously undescribed sequences that were structurally similar to those of 
      antimicrobial peptides isolated from other species of leptodactylid frogs. These 
      paralogs have been termed ocellatin-V1 (GVVDILKGAGKDLLAHALSKLSEKV.NH(2)), 
      ocellatin-V2 (GVLDILKGAGKDLLAHALSKISEKV.NH(2)), and ocellatin-V3 
      (GVLDILTGAGKDLLAHALSKLSEKV.NH(2)). The very low antimicrobial potency 
      (MIC>200microM) against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus associated with 
      the peptides is probably a consequence of their lack of amphipathicity and reduced 
      cationicity compared with active members of the ocellatin family from related 
      species.

TI  - Effects of amino acid deletion and substitution on the chemical properties, 
      biological activities of the frog peptide palustrin-OG1.
PG  - 813-9
AB  - Palustrin-OG1 (OG1) is a host defense peptide isolated from the frog Odorrana 
      grahami. In this study, we analyzed the chemical properties, antimicrobial 
      activities and cytotoxicities of OG1 and its derivatives to identify the most 
      promising peptide as an antimicrobial agent. By increasing the net positive charge, 
      amphipathicity and decreasing the mean hydrophobicity of OG1, the derivative named 
      as OG2 exerted higher antimicrobial activity against bacteria but lower cytotoxicity 
      against both porcine erythrocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells than did 
      OG1 (P<0.01). After substitution of Cys residues of OG2 by Ala or Trp residues, two 
      derivatives named as OG2A and OG2W were less effective against bacteria and induced 
      greater hemolysis than did OG2, indicating the importance of Cys residues. The 
      substitution of the C-terminal Thr of OG2 resulted OG2N, which decreased the 
      cytotoxicity and improved killing kinetics against gram-positive bacteria by the 
      rapid damage of cell wall and membrane.

TI  - The host-defence skin peptide profiles of Peron's Tree Frog Litoria peronii in 
      winter and summer. Sequence determination by electrospray mass spectrometry and 
      activities of the peptides.
PG  - 2628-36
LID - 10.1002/rcm.4164 [doi]
AB  - Positive and negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry together with Edman 
      sequencing (when appropriate) has been used to sequence the host-defence peptides 
      secreted from skin glands of the tree frog Litoria peronii. The peptide profiles are 
      different in winter and summer. In winter, the frog produces small amounts of the 
      known caerin 1.1 [GLLSVLGSVAKHVLPHVVPVIAEHL-NH(2)] (a wide-spectrum antibiotic) and 
      caerin 2.1 [GLVSSIGRALGGLLADVVKSKQPA-OH], a narrow-spectrum antibiotic and an 
      inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase. The major peptides produced throughout 
      the year are the pGlu-containing peroniins 1.1 to 1.5 (e.g. peroniin 1.1 
      [pEPWLPFG-NH(2)], a smooth muscle contractor from 10(-7) M), and caerulein 
      [pEQDY(SO(3)H)TGWMDF-NH(2)], a known and potent smooth muscle contractor from 
      10(-10) M. There are also some precursors to the peroniin 1 peptides, only detected 
      in the skin secretion in summer, which are inactive and appear to be all (or part) 
      of the spacer peroniin 1 peptides, e.g. peroniin 1.1b [SEEEKRQPWLPFG-NH(2)]. There 
      are three members of the Litoria peronii Group of tree frogs classified in 
      Australia, namely, L. peronii, L. rothii and L.tyleri. A comparison of the skin 
      peptide profiles of L. peronii with those reported previously for L. rothii suggests 
      that either these two species of tree frog are not as closely related as determined 
      previously on morphological grounds, or that skin peptide divergence in tree frogs 
      of this Group is more extensive than in others that have been studied.

TI  - A glycine-leucine-rich peptide structurally related to the plasticins from skin 
      secretions of the frog Leptodactylus laticeps (Leptodactylidae).
PG  - 888-92
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.01.008 [doi]
AB  - A glycine-leucine-rich peptide was isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
      secretions of the Sante Fe frog Leptodactylus laticeps (Leptodactylidae) whose 
      primary structure 
      (Gly-Leu-Val-Asn-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-Ser-Val-Leu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ile-Leu) 
      contains the (GXXXG)(3) motif found in the plasticins, previously identified only in 
      phyllomedusid frogs (Hylidae). Circular dichroism studies showed that the secondary 
      structure of the peptide, termed plasticin-L1, was markedly solvent-dependent 
      displaying a random coil conformation in water, a beta-sheet structure in methanol, 
      and an alpha-helical conformation in 50% trifluoroethanol-water. A synthetic 
      replicate of the peptide did not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli or 
      Staphylococcus aureus or lyse human erythrocytes at concentrations up to 500 microM. 
      At relatively high concentrations (>or=1 microM), the peptide produced a significant 
      (P<0.05), although modest (139% of basal rate at 3 microM), increase in the rate of 
      glucose-induced release of insulin from rat clonal BRIN-BD11 beta cells without 
      increasing the rate of release of lactate dehydrogenase. A peptide, termed 
      ocellatin-L2 was also identified in the skin secretion that was identical to the 
      previously described ocellatin-L1 except for the substitution Asn(23)-->Asp. 
      Ocellatin-L2 was devoid of antimicrobial and hemolytic activity but also showed 
      significant activity in stimulating insulin release from BRIN-BD11 cells (181% of 
      basal rate at 3 microM).

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent new alternatives to cope with the increasing 
      number of multi-drug resistant microbial infections. Recently, a derivative of the 
      frog-skin AMP esculentin-1a, Esc(1-21), was found to rapidly kill both the 
      planktonic and biofilm forms of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      with a membrane-perturbing activity as a plausible mode of action. Lately, its 
      diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c containing two d-amino acids i.e. (D)Leu14 and (D)Ser17 
      revealed to be less cytotoxic, more stable to proteolytic degradation and more 
      efficient in eradicating Pseudomonas biofilm. When tested in vitro against the 
      free-living form of this pathogen, it displayed potent bactericidal activity, but 
      this was weaker than that of the all-l peptide. To investigate the reason accounting 
      for this difference, mechanistic studies were performed on Pseudomonas spheroplasts 
      and anionic or zwitterionic membranes, mimicking the composition of microbial and 
      mammalian membranes, respectively. Furthermore, structural studies by means of 
      optical and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies were carried out. Our results 
      suggest that the different extent in the bactericidal activity between the two 
      isomers is principally due to differences in their interaction with the bacterial 
      cell wall components. Indeed, the lower ability in binding and perturbing anionic 
      phospholipid bilayers for Esc(1-21)-1c contributes only in a small part to this 
      difference, while the final effect of membrane thinning once the peptide is inserted 
      into the membrane is identical to that provoked by Esc(1-21). In addition, the 
      presence of two d-amino acids is sufficient to reduce the α-helical content of the 
      peptide, in parallel with its lower cytotoxicity.

AB  - Cationic peptides with the propensity to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical 
      conformation in a membrane-mimetic environment are synthesized in the skin of many 
      species of frogs. These peptides frequently display potent cytolytic activities 
      against a range of pathogenic bacteria and fungi, consistent with the hypothesis 
      that they play a role in host defense. However, the importance of the peptides in 
      the survival strategy of the animal is not clearly understood. At this time, 
      antimicrobial peptides have been identified in the skin of frogs from species 
      belonging to the Bombinatoridae, Hylidae, Hyperoliidae, Leiopelmatidae, 
      Leptodactylidae, Myobatrachidae, Pipidae, and Ranidae families, but several 
      well-studied species from the Bufonidae, Ceratophryidae, Dicroglossidae, 
      Microhylidae, Pelobatidae, Pyxicephalidae, Rhacophoridae, and Scaphiopodidae 
      families do not appear to synthesize these peptides. Although cytolytic activity 
      against the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, responsible for anuran 
      population declines worldwide, has been demonstrated in vitro, the ability of frog 
      skin antimicrobial peptides to protect the animal in the wild appears to be limited. 
      While the production of dermal cytolytic peptides may offer definite evolutionary 
      advantage to anurans, their precise biological function, for example during 
      metamorphosis, may need to be re-evaluated.

AB  - Peptides in extract of the skin of the Asian frog Hylarana guntheri Boulenger,1882 
      were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and individual components analysed for their 
      ability to release insulin from the rat BRIN-BD11 clonal beta cell line. The most 
      potent peptide identified in the extract belonged to the brevinin-2 family 
      (brevinin-2GUb; GVIIDTLKGAAKTVAAELLRKAHCKLTNSC). Other peptides with weaker 
      insulin-releasing activity belonged to the brevinin-1 (2 peptides), brevinin-2 (2 
      peptides) and temporin (3 peptides) families. Only the brevinin-1 peptides showed 
      cytolytic activity against the BRIN-BD11 cells, as demonstrated by an increased rate 
      of release of the cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase. A synthetic replicate of 
      brevinin-2GUb produced a significant stimulation of insulin release (139% of basal 
      rate; P<0.05) at a concentration of 100 nM with a maximum response of 373% of basal 
      rate at a concentration of 3 microM) by a mechanism that did not involve 
      mobilization of intracellular calcium. Brevinin-2GUb also inhibited the growth of 
      microorganisms (MIC against Escherichia coli=32 microM, Staphylococcus aureus=64 
      microM, and Candida albicans=64 microM) but had only weak hemolytic activity against 
      human erythrocytes (LC(50)=700 microM). Administration of brevinin-2GUb (75 nmol/kg 
      body weight) into mice significantly (P<0.05) improved glucose tolerance following a 
      intraperitoneal injection of glucose, thereby demonstrating that the peptide shows 
      potential for development into a therapeutically valuable agent for the treatment of 
      Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Synergistic inhibition of the lethal fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis: 
      the combined effect of symbiotic bacterial metabolites and antimicrobial peptides of

PG  - 958-65
LID - 10.1007/s10886-012-0170-2 [doi]
AB  - A powerful mechanism for protection against disease in animals is synergy between 
      metabolites present in the natural microbiota of the host and antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs) produced by the host. We studied this method of protection in amphibians in 
      regard to the lethal disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis (Bd). In this study, we show that the AMPs of Rana muscosa, as well as 
      the metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) from Pseudomonas fluorescens, a 
      bacterial species normally found on the skin of R. muscosa, were inhibitory to the 
      growth of Bd in vitro. When both AMPs and 2,4-DAPG were used in growth inhibition 
      assays, they worked synergistically to inhibit the growth of Bd. This synergy 
      resulted in reduced minimum concentrations necessary for inhibition by either 
      2,4-DAPG or AMPs. This inhibitory concentration of AMPs did not inhibit the growth 
      of a P. fluorescens strain that produced 2,4-DAPG in vitro, although its growth was 
      inhibited at higher peptide concentrations. These data suggest that the AMPs 
      secreted onto frog skin and the metabolites secreted by the resident beneficial 
      bacteria may work synergistically to enhance protection against Bd infection on 
      amphibian skin. These results may aid conservation efforts to augment amphibian 
      skins' resistance to chytridiomycosis by introducing anti-Bd bacterial species that 
      work synergistically with amphibian AMPs.

TI  - Leishmanicidal activity and immobilization of dermaseptin 01 antimicrobial peptides

PG  - 352-8
LID - 10.1016/j.nano.2008.11.001 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential for the innate immune system of 
      eukaryotes, imparting protection against pathogens and their proliferation in host 
      organisms. The recent interest in AMPs as active materials in bionanostructures is 
      due to the properties shown by these biological molecules, such as the presence of 
      an alpha-helix structure and distribution of positive charges along the chain. In 
      this study the antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin 01 (DS 01), from the skin secretion 
      of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis frogs was immobilized in nanostructured layered 
      films in conjunction with nickel tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines. The leishmanicidal 
      activity of DS 01 was confirmed using kinetic essays, in which DS 01 promoted death 
      of all metacyclic promastigote cells in 45 minutes. Surprisingly, the immobilized DS 
      01 molecules displayed electroactivity, as revealed by electrochemical experiments, 
      in which an oxidation peak at about 0.61 V was observed for a DS 01 monolayer 
      deposited on top of a conductive electrode. Such electroactivity was used to 
      investigate the sensing abilities of the nanostructured films toward Leishmania. We 
      observed an increase in the oxidation current as a function of number of Leishmania 
      cells in the electrolytic solution at concentrations down to 10(3) cells/mL. The 
      latter is indicative that the use of AMPs immobilized in electroactive 
      nanostructured films may be of interest for applications in the pharmaceutical 
      industry and diagnosis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: The recent interest in 
      Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as active materials in bionanostructures is due to the 
      properties shown by these biological molecules. Leishmanicidal activity of a 
      particular AMP is demonstrated in this paper.

TI  - Evidence from peptidomic analysis of skin secretions that the red-legged frogs, Rana 
      aurora draytonii and Rana aurora aurora, are distinct species.
PG  - 1305-12
AB  - The northern red-legged frog Rana aurora aurora and the California red-legged frog 
      Rana aurora draytonii are traditionally classified together in the same species 
      group. Ten peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of R. aurora draytonii and purified to 
      near homogeneity. The peptides were identified as belonging to the ranatuerin-2 
      family (two peptides), brevinin-1 family (four peptides), temporin family (three 
      peptides), and a novel peptide, RV-23 (RIGVLLARLPKLFSLFKLMGKKV) that has limited 
      structural similarity to the bee venom peptide, melittin. This distribution of 
      peptides contrasts with that found previously in skin secretions from R. aurora 
      aurora collected under the same conditions and at the same time of year (one 
      ranatuerin-2 peptide, two brevinin-1 peptides, and one temporin peptide). The 
      variation in amino acid sequences between corresponding R. aurora draytonii and R. 
      aurora aurora peptides is comparable with the variation in sequences of orthologs 
      from other members of the Amerana group of New World ranid frogs (Rana boylii, Rana 
      muscosa, and Rana luteiventris). It is proposed, therefore, that the red-legged 
      frogs should be regarded as separate species (R. aurora and R. draytonii) within the 
      Amerana group rather than conspecific subspecies. The data emphasize that amino acid 
      sequences of antimicrobial peptides in skin secretions may be used to infer 
      taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships between species of ranid frogs.

TI  - Comparison of pathogen-induced expression and efficacy of two amphibian 
      antimicrobial peptides, MsrA2 and temporin A, for engineering wide-spectrum disease 
      resistance in tobacco.
PG  - 720-34
AB  - The rapid accumulation of defensive transgene products in plants only on pathogen 
      invasion has clear advantages over their constitutive synthesis. In this study, two 
      antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of frogs, MsrA2 
      (N-methionine-dermaseptin B1) and temporin A, were evaluated for engineering 
      pathogen-induced disease resistance in plants. Both peptides inhibited 
      plant-specific pathogens in vitro at micromolar concentrations that were not toxic 
      to plant protoplasts. The plant-optimized nucleotide sequences encoding MsrA2 and 
      temporin A were transcriptionally fused to the inducible win3.12T poplar promoter, 
      which had strong systemic activity in response to fungal infection, and introduced 
      into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi). Transgene expression was very low in 
      the leaves of unstressed plants; however, it was strongly increased after pathogen 
      challenge or wounding. The pathogen responsiveness of the win3.12T promoter was 
      found to be universal rather than species specific, with high activity in response 
      to all pathogens tested. On induction, the amount of MsrA2 was up to 6-7 microg per 
      gram of fresh leaf tissue. Most importantly, the induced accumulation of MsrA2 and 
      temporin A in transgenic tobacco was sufficient to confer resistance to a variety of 
      phytopathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium solani, F. oxysporum, Alternaria alternata, 
      Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum and 
      the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum. The accumulation of these peptides in 
      transgenic plants did not alter the normal phenotype of tobacco. Thus, the 
      expression of MsrA2 and temporin A in a pathogen-inducible manner enables the 
      development of tobacco, and possibly other plant species, with wide-spectrum disease 
      resistance, which can reduce the use of pesticides and the associated environmental 
      risks.

TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of the N-terminal fragment of the frog peptide 
      esculentin-1b (Esc 1-18) in combination with conventional antibiotics against 
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
PG  - 1622-6
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.06.004 [doi]
AB  - In this study the bactericidal effect of the N-terminal fragment of the frog skin 
      peptide esculentin-1b [Esc(1-18)] in combination with clinically used antimicrobial 
      agents was evaluated against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, either in standard 
      conditions (phosphate buffer) or in the presence of human serum. A synergistic 
      bactericidal effect was observed after a 24h incubation when combinations of 
      Esc(1-18) and amikacin or colistin were used against clinical strains of S. 
      maltophilia with or without resistance to these antibiotics, both in buffer and in 
      the presence of serum. An indifferent effect was observed when the peptide was 
      combined with levofloxacin or ceftazidime. A synergistic effect was also observed at 
      earlier time points when the peptide was used in combination with colistin. 
      Sequential exposure of bacterial cells to Esc(1-18) and amikacin or colistin, or 
      vice versa, indicated that while Esc(1-18) and colistin cooperated in enhancing the 
      bactericidal effect of their combination, when Esc(1-18) was combined with amikacin, 
      the peptide had a major role in initiating the bactericidal effect, while amikacin 
      was required for the subsequent effector phase. Altogether, the results obtained 
      indicate that exposure of S. maltophilia to sub-bactericidal concentrations of 
      Esc(1-18) increases its susceptibility to amikacin or colistin and may also render 
      resistant strains susceptible to these antibiotics.

TI  - Isolation and structural characterization of novel Rugosin A-like insulinotropic 
      peptide from the skin secretions of Rana saharica frog.
PG  - 2117-23
AB  - Skin secretions of Rana saharica were evaluated for the isolation and 
      characterization of novel insulinotropic peptides. Crude secretions obtained from 
      young adult frogs by mild electrical stimulation of the dorsal skin surface were 
      purified by reversed-phase HPLC yielding 80 fractions. In acute incubations with 
      glucose-responsive BRIN-BD11cells, fractions 36-43, 46-54 and 57-63 showed the 
      significant 2-8-fold increase in insulin-releasing activity (P<0.001) compared with 
      5.6mM of glucose alone. A pool of fractions 36-43 was subsequently rechromatographed 
      to 28 homogenous peaks out of which 7 were capable of subsequent 1.5-3-fold increase 
      in insulin release (P<0.001). Structural analysis of the non-toxic peptides with 
      greatest insulin-releasing activity was performed by mass spectrometry and Edman 
      degradation. Mass spectrometry analysis of two peaks indicated the molecular masses 
      of 1892.6 and 2930.8Da. The sequence of the 1892.6-Da peptide was determined as 
      KGAAKGLLEVASCKLSKSC, which has 68% homology with Rugosin A originally isolated from 
      the skin secretion of Rana rugosa. A partial N-terminal sequence was determined for 
      the 2930.8-Da peptide as AVITGACERDVQCGGGTCCAVSLI.... These data indicate that the 
      skin secretions of Rana saharica frogs contain novel peptides with insulin-releasing 
      activity.

TI  - Identification and bioactivity evaluation of a novel bradykinin inhibitory peptide 
      from the skin secretion of Chinese large odorous frog, Odorrana livida.
PG  - 181-5
LID - 10.1002/psc.2856 [doi]
AB  - A novel peptide was isolated from the skin secretion of Chinese large odorous frog, 
      Odorrana livida, and was named as Rana-BI. The cDNA sequencing was obtained by 
      'shotgun' cloning. The amino acid sequence of the mature peptide was identified as 
      Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-Gly-Lys-Ser-Val-Lys-Gly-Ser-Ile-OH by automated Edman degradation, 
      and the molecular weight of the peptide was confirmed to be 1144.68 Da by MALDI-TOF 
      and liquid chromatography/MS. Subsequently, the bioactivity of synthetic peptide was 
      evaluated by smooth muscle assay using isolated rat bladder preparation. It was 
      demonstrated that Rana-BI inhibited the contraction of rat bladder induced by 
      bradykinin. Comparing with other peptides by searching from database, the primary 
      structure of Rana-BI showed high similarity with that of an antimicrobial peptide of 
      Rana family (12/12 residues). These data revealed a novel biological function of 
      this peptide.

TI  - The Potential of Frog Skin-Derived Peptides for Development into 
      Therapeutically-Valuable Immunomodulatory Agents.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22122071 [doi]
LID - 2071
AB  - The aim of this article is to review the immunoregulatory actions of frog 
      skin-derived peptides in order to assess their potential as candidates for 
      immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory therapy. Frog skin peptides with demonstrable 
      immunomodulatory properties have been isolated from skin secretions of a range of 
      species belonging to the families Alytidae, Ascaphidae, Discoglossidae, 
      Leptodactylidae, Pipidae and Ranidae. Their effects upon production of inflammatory 
      and immunoregulatory cytokines by target cells have been evaluated ex vivo and 
      effects upon cytokine expression and immune cell activity have been studied in vivo 
      by flow cytometry after injection into mice. The naturally-occurring peptides and/or 
      their synthetic analogues show complex and variable actions on the production of 
      proinflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-23, IL-8, IFN-γ and IL-17), pleiotropic 
      (IL-4 and IL-6) and immunosuppressive (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines by peripheral and 
      spleen cells, peritoneal cells and/or isolated macrophages. The effects of frenatin 
      2.1S include enhancement of the activation state and homing capacity of Th1-type 
      lymphocytes and NK cells in the mouse peritoneal cavity, as well as the promotion of 
      their tumoricidal capacities. Overall, the diverse effects of frog skin-derived 
      peptides on the immune system indicate their potential for development into 
      therapeutic agents.

AB  - Amphibian skin secretions have proven to be rich sources of antimicrobial peptides 
      that are proposed to be fundamental components of the innate immune system. As 
      amphibian skin is a multi-functional organ playing, among other things, a crucial 
      role in respiration, it has been deemed that a core biological role for such 
      peptides is control of microbial flora on this surface. To date, however, 
      antimicrobial efficacy has been universally determined by means of establishing 
      minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using planktonic organisms rather than 
      those within a biofilm such as would occur on this exposed surface. Here we describe 
      the identification and structural characterisation of a novel 19 amino acid residue 
      antimicrobial peptide of the phylloseptin family, named PSN-1, from the skin 
      secretion of the waxy monkey frog, Phyllomedusa sauvagei. PSN-1 displayed 
      broad-spectrum activity against a range of planktonic organisms with a high potency 
      (MIC 5 microM) against Staphylococcus aureus. In a specific bioassay with the same 
      organism grown as a biofilm, the minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) 
      was found to be of the same high potency (5 microM). The present data would suggest 
      that evaluation of actions and potency of amphibian skin secretion antimicrobial 
      peptides might best be achieved by evaluating MBEC rather than MIC using planktonic 
      organisms and that data arising from such studies may have more biological relevance 
      in reflecting the purpose for which they have evolved through natural selection.

TI  - Cloning and expression of genes enocoding antimicrobial peptides and bradykinin from 
      the skin and brain of Oki Tago's brown frog, Rana tagoi okiensis.
PG  - 1480-7
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.04.031 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies led to the isolation from skin extracts of Oki Tago's brown frog, 
      Rana tagoi okiensis of five antimicrobial peptides belonging to the brevinin-1 
      (brevinin-1TOa), temporin (temporin-TOa and -TOb), and ranatuerin-2 (ranatuerin-2TOa 
      and -2TOb) families, and bradykinin (BK) identical to mammalian BK. Using the 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have now cloned from 
      skin total RNA preparations cDNAs encoding biosynthetic precursors of brevinin-1TOa 
      and brevinin-1TOb (containing the substitution Gly(1)-->Val), temporin-TOa and -TOb, 
      and ranatuerin-2TOa and -2TOb. In addition, three cDNA clones encoding 
      preprobradykinins were obtained that contained either one, two, or three tandem 
      repeats of the sequence of BK followed by the sequence of [Thr(6)]-BK. In tissue 
      expression analyses, preprobrevinin-1, preprotemporin, and preproranatuerin-2 gene 
      transcripts were detected at higher levels in brain compared with peripheral tissues 
      (heart, small intestine, kidney, liver lung, skeletal muscle, stomach, and testis). 
      RT-PCR of brain RNA resulted in the amplification of cDNAs encoding ranatuerin-2TOc 
      and ranatuerin-2TOd that contained the amino acid substitutions Lys(6)-->Arg and 
      Ala(14)-->Thr, respectively compared with ranatuerin-2TOb. cDNAs encoding 
      preprobrevinin-1TOa and preprotemporin-TOa were amplified from brain RNA as well as 
      a second preprotemporin cDNA that contained a 10-nucleotide insertion that 
      introduced a frame shift resulting in a premature stop codon. A cDNA encoding a 
      novel peptide, DK25 (DVNDLKNLCAKTHNLLPMCAMFGKK) was amplified from brain RNA but 
      neither DK25 nor its putative post-translationally modified form, DF22-amide 
      (DVNDLKNLCAKTHNLLPMCAMF.NH(2)) displayed antimicrobial or hemolytic activities.

TI  - Exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis affects chemical defences in two anuran 
      amphibians, Rana dalmatina and Bufo bufo.
PG  - 135
LID - 10.1186/s12862-021-01867-w [doi]
LID - 135
AB  - BACKGROUND: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is the causative agent of 
      chytridiomycosis, one of the major causes of worldwide amphibian biodiversity loss. 
      Many amphibians exhibit skin-based chemical defences, which may play an important 
      role against invading pathogens, but whether the synthesis of these chemical 
      compounds is enhanced or suppressed in the presence of pathogens is largely unknown. 
      Here we investigated direct and indirect effects of larval exposure to the globally 
      distributed and highly virulent Bd-GPL strain on skin secreted chemical defences and 
      life history traits during early ontogeny of agile frogs (Rana dalmatina) and common 
      toads (Bufo bufo). RESULTS: Exposure to Bd during the larval stage did not result in 
      enhanced synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide Brevinin-1 Da in R. dalmatina 
      tadpoles or in increased production of bufadienolides in B. bufo tadpoles. However, 
      exposure to Bd during the larval stage had a carry-over effect reaching beyond 
      metamorphosis: both R. dalmatina and B. bufo froglets contained smaller quantities 
      of defensive chemicals than their Bd-naïve conspecifics in the control treatment. 
      Prevalence of Bd and infection intensities were very low in both larvae and 
      metamorphs of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo we observed high Bd prevalence and 
      infection intensities, especially in metamorphs. At the same time, we did not find a 
      significant effect of Bd-exposure on body mass or development rate in larvae or 
      metamorphs in either species. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of detrimental effect of 
      Bd-exposure on life history traits, even parallel with high infection intensities in 
      the case of B. bufo individuals, is surprising and suggests high tolerance of local 
      populations of these two species against Bd. However, the lowered quantity of 
      defensive chemicals may compromise antimicrobial and antipredatory defences of 
      froglets, which may ultimately contribute to population declines also in the absence 
      of conspicuous mass-mortality events.

TI  - Isolation and biochemical characterization of peptides presenting antimicrobial 
      activity from the skin of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis.
PG  - 3092-9
AB  - Amphibian antimicrobial peptides have been known for many decades and several of 
      them have been isolated from anuran species. Dermaseptins are among the most studied 
      antimicrobial peptides and are found in the skin secretion of tree frogs from the 
      Phyllomedusinae subfamily. These peptides exert a lytic action on bacteria, 
      protozoa, yeast, and filamentous fungi at micromolar concentrations, but unlike 
      polylysines, present little hemolytic activity. In this work, two antimicrobial 
      peptides were isolated from the crude skin secretion of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis 
      and tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, presenting no hemolytic 
      activity at the tested concentrations. One of them was identified with the recently 
      reported peptide PS-7 belonging to the phylloseptin family, and another was a novel 
      peptide, named DPh-1, which was fully purified, sequenced by 'de novo' mass 
      spectrometry and grouped into Dermaseptins (DPh-1).

TI  - Identification and functional analyses of novel antioxidant peptides and 
      antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of four East Asian frog species.
PG  - 550-559
LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmx032 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we identified 50 peptides that are classified into 21 peptide 
      families with antioxidant and/or antimicrobial activity from Amolops daiyunensis, 
      Pelophylax hubeiensis, Hylarana maosuoensis and Nanorana pleskei, which belong to 
      four different genera in the Ranidae and Dicroglossidae families. These four frog 
      species were found for the first time to express antioxidant peptides (AOPs) and 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These peptides include seven newly discovered 
      families daiyunin-1, daiyunin-2, daiyunin-3, maosonensis-1MS1, pleskein-1, 
      pleskein-2, and pleskein-3. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activity assays showed 
      that some of these peptides have good biological activities. For example, at a 
      concentration of 50 μM, nigroain-B-MS1, and nigroain-C-MS1 both exhibited relatively

AB  - We describe the isolation and characterisation of an insulinotropic peptide from the 
      skin secretions of Agalychnis calcarifer frogs. Peptides in crude secretions 
      obtained by mild electrical stimulation from the dorsal skin surface were purified 
      by reversed-phase HPLC, yielding fractions in two zones with insulin-releasing 
      activity ( p <0.001). The peaks showing greatest in vitro insulin-releasing activity 
      were subsequently purified to homogeneity, revealing a novel insulinotropic 
      13-amino-acid (1653.2 Da) peptide with the primary structure RRKPLFPFIPRPK 
      [corrected] (RK-13). A database search for RK-13 showed 53.8% similarity with the 
      N-terminal region of proline-arginine-rich antimicrobial peptide (PR-39). Synthetic 
      RK-13 stimulated insulin release in a dose-dependent, glucose-sensitive manner, 
      exerting its effects through a cyclic AMP-protein kinase A pathway independent of 
      pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Unlike PR-39, RK-13 lacks antimicrobial 
      effects on the growth of yeast, and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Our 
      data indicate that skin secretions of Agalychnis calcarifer frogs contain 
      insulin-releasing peptides, including RK-13, which merit further investigation as 
      insulin secretagogues.

AB  - The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of bioactive peptides can be 
      modulated by introducing conformational constraints such as intramolecular 
      macrocyclizations, which can involve either the backbone and/or side chains. Herein, 
      we aimed at increasing the α-helicity content of temporin L, an isoform of an 
      intriguing class of linear antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), endowed with a wide 
      antimicrobial spectrum, by the employment of diverse side-chain tethering 
      strategies, including lactam, 1,4-substituted [1,2,3]-triazole, hydrocarbon, and 
      disulfide linkers. Our approach resulted in a library of cyclic temporin L analogues 
      that were biologically assessed for their antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and antibiofilm 
      activities, leading to the development of the first-in-class cyclic peptide related 
      to this AMP family. Our results allowed us to expand the knowledge regarding the 
      relationship between the α-helical character of temporin derivatives and their 
      biological activity, paving the way for the development of improved antibiotic 
      cyclic AMP analogues.

AB  - In this study, two novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the 
      marsh frog, Rana ridibunda, named temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb, were identified and 
      purified using RP-HPLC. Temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb are composed of 14 and 12 amino 
      acids, respectively. Our results show that these peptides have inhibitory effects on 
      both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially antibiotic resistant 
      strains prevalent in hospitals, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus 
      agalactiae. The sequences and molecular weights of these peptides were determined 
      using tandem MS. The molecular masses were found to be 1242.5 Da for temporin-Rb and 
      1585.1 Da for temporin-Ra. Human red blood cells tolerated well exposure to 
      temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb, which, at a concentration of 60 µg/ml, induced 1.3% and 
      1.1% hemolysis, respectively. MIC values of these peptides are suitable for potent 
      antimicrobial peptides. The low hemolytic effect and wide-spectrum antimicrobial 
      activity suggest a possible therapeutic application of these novel peptides.

      pathway.
PG  - 481-494

AB  - Modification of the poplar defense pathway through pathogen-induced expression of an 
      amphibian host defense peptide modulates plant innate immunity and confers robust 
      and reliable resistance against a major poplar pathogen, Septoria musiva. Host 
      defense peptides (HDPs), also known as cationic antimicrobial peptides, represent a 
      diverse group of small membrane-active molecules that are part of the innate defense 
      system of their hosts against pathogen invasion. Here we describe a strategy for 
      development of poplar plants with enhanced HDP production and resistance to the 
      commercially significant fungal pathogen Septoria musiva. The naturally occurring 
      linear amphipathic α-helical HDP dermaseptin B1, which has 31 residues and 
      originated from the skin secretion of arboreal frogs, was N-terminally modified 
      (MsrA2) and evaluated in vitro for antifungal activity and phytotoxicity. The MsrA2 
      peptide inhibited germination of S. musiva conidia at physiologically relevant low 
      micromolar concentrations that were non-toxic to poplar protoplasts. The nucleotide 
      sequence of MsrA2, optimized for expression in plants, was introduced into the 
      commercial hybrid poplar Populus nigra L. × P. maximowiczii A. Henry (NM6) via 
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgene expression was regulated by the 
      pathogen-inducible poplar promoter win3.12T, a part of the poplar innate defense 
      system. Most importantly, the induced accumulation of MsrA2 peptide in poplar leaves 
      was sufficient to confer resistance against S. musiva. The antifungal resistance of 
      plants with high MsrA2 expression and MsrA2 accumulation was strong and 
      reproducible, and without deleterious effects on plant growth and development. These 
      results provide an insight into development of new technologies for engineering 
      durable disease resistance against major pathogens of poplar and other plants.

LID - 10.3390/ph7010058 [doi]
AB  - Skin secretions from frogs belonging to the genera Xenopus, Silurana, Hymenochirus, 
      and Pseudhymenochirus in the family Pipidae are a rich source of host-defense 
      peptides with varying degrees of antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicities to 
      mammalian cells. Magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa), caerulein-precursor 
      fragment (CPF), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) peptides have been isolated 
      from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from several species of Xenopus and 
      Silurana. Hymenochirins and pseudhymenochirins have been isolated from Hymenochirus 
      boettgeri and Pseudhymenochirus merlini. A major obstacle to the development of 
      these peptides as anti-infective agents is their hemolytic activities against human 
      erythrocytes. Analogs of the magainins, CPF peptides and hymenochirin-1B with 
      increased antimicrobial potencies and low cytotoxicities have been developed that 
      are active (MIC < 5 μM) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of 
      Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas 
      maltophilia and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Despite this, the therapeutic potential of 
      frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents has not been realized so that 
      alternative clinical applications as anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, or 
      immunomodulatory drugs are being explored.

TI  - Identification and characterization of novel bi-functional cathelicidins from the 
      black-spotted frog (Pelophylax nigromaculata) with both anti-infective and 
      antioxidant activities.

AB  - Cathelicidins are an important family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which play 
      pivotal roles in vertebrate immune responses against microbial infections. They are 
      regarded as potential drug leads for the development of novel antimicrobial agents 
      and three related drugs have been developed into clinical trials. Thus, it is 
      meaningful to identify more cathelicidins from vertebrate species. Cathelicidins 
      from ranid frogs possess special structural characteristics and activities, but to 
      date only 12 ranid frog cathelicidins have been identified. In the present study, 
      two novel cathelicidins (PN-CATH1 and 2) were identified from the black-spotted 
      frog, Pelophylax nigromaculata. PN-CATHs possess low sequence similarity with the 
      known cathelicidins. They exhibited moderate, but broad-spectrum and rapid 
      antimicrobial activities against the tested bacteria. They kill bacteria by mainly 
      inducing bacterial membrane disruption and possibly generating intracellular ROS 
      formation. They also possess potent anti-biofilm and persister cell killing 
      activity, indicating their potential in combating infections induced by 
      biofilms-forming bacteria. Besides direct antimicrobial activity, they exhibited 
      potent anti-inflammatory activity by effectively inhibiting the LPS-induced 
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse macrophages, which could be partly 
      ascribed to their direct LPS-neutralizing ability. Furthermore, PN-CATHs 
      demonstrated powerful in vitro free radical scavenging activities. Ultraviolet 
      radiation significantly increased their in vivo gene expression in frog skin. 
      Meanwhile, they possess weak cytotoxic activity and extremely low hemolytic 
      activity. PN-CATHs represent the first discovery of cathelicidins family AMPs with 
      both potent anti-infective and antioxidant activities. The discovery of PN-CATHs 
      provides potential peptide leads for the development of novel anti-infective and 
      antioxidant drugs.

      frog skin as anti-cancer, anti-viral, immunomodulatory, and anti-diabetic agents.

AB  - Frog skin constitutes a rich source of peptides with a wide range of biological 
      properties. These include host-defense peptides with cytotoxic activities against 
      bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and mammalian cells. Several hundred such 
      peptides from diverse species have been described. Although attention has been 
      focused mainly on antimicrobial activity, the therapeutic potential of frog skin 
      peptides as anti-infective agents remains to be realized and no compound based upon 
      their structures has yet been adopted in clinical practice. Consequently, 
      alternative applications are being explored. Certain naturally occurring frog skin 
      peptides, and analogs with improved therapeutic properties, show selective 
      cytotoxicity against tumor cells and viruses and so have potential for development 
      into anti-cancer and anti-viral agents. Some peptides display complex 
      cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties. Effects on the production of both 
      pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines by peritoneal macrophages and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been observed so that clinical applications 
      as anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and immunostimulatory agents are possible. 
      Several frog skin peptides, first identified on the basis of antimicrobial activity, 
      have been shown to stimulate insulin release both in vitro and in vivo and so show 
      potential as incretin-based therapies for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. This review assesses the therapeutic possibilities of peptides from frogs 
      belonging to the Ascaphidae, Alytidae, Pipidae, Dicroglossidae, Leptodactylidae, 
      Hylidae, and Ranidae families that complement their potential role as 
      anti-infectives for use against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.

TI  - Isolation, characterization and molecular cloning of new antimicrobial peptides 
      belonging to the brevinin-1 and temporin families from the skin of Hylarana 
      latouchii (Anura: Ranidae).
PG  - 540-7
AB  - Around 40 species of Hylarana amphibians are distributed in tropical and subtropical 
      Asia, and Chinese broad-folded frog, Hylarana latouchii (Boulenger, 1899) is one of 
      them. In this study, six different cDNAs encoding four novel antimicrobial peptide 
      precursors were cloned by screening the cDNA library of the Chinese broad-folded 
      frog skin. The protein sequence analysis demonstrated that two deduced peptides 
      belong to the brevinin-1 family, and the other two belong to temporin family of 
      amphibian antimicrobial peptides. Thus, they were named as brevinin-1LT1 
      (FMGSALRIAAKVLPAALCQIFKKC), brevinin-1LT2 (FFGSVLKVAAKVLPAALCQIFKKC), temporin-LT1 
      (FLPGLIAGIAKML-NH2) and temporin-LT2 (FLPIALKALGSIFPKIL-NH2), respectively. 
      Furthermore, brevinin-1LT1 and temporin-LT1 were purified by HPLC from the skin 
      secretion of H. latouchii. In this work, all the peptides kill microbes by 
      membrane-disturbing mechanisms, and this procedure was visualized via scanning 
      electron microscopy (SEM).

TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, 
      temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic 
      bacteria.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family 
      (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two 
      peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from 
      Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference 
      strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected 
      because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference 
      strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical 
      isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed 
      relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) 
      against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium 
      and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and 
      more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and 
      Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides 
      fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were 
      active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of 
      the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and 
      temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and 
      so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of 
      infected surface lesions.

TI  - Structural study of novel antimicrobial peptides, nigrocins, isolated from Rana 
      nigromaculata.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - Novel cationic antimicrobial peptides, named nigrocin 1 and 2, were isolated from 
      the skin of Rana nigromaculata and their amino acid sequences were determined. These 
      peptides manifested a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various 
      microorganisms with different specificity. By primary structural analysis, it was 
      revealed that nigrocin 1 has high sequence homology with brevinin 2 but nigrocin 2 
      has low sequence homology with any other known antimicrobial peptides. To 
      investigate the structure-activity relationship of nigrocin 2, which has a unique 
      primary structure, circular dichroism (CD) and homonuclear nuclear magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies were performed. CD investigation revealed that 
      nigrocin 2 adopts mainly an alpha-helical structure in trifluoroethanol (TFE)/H(2)O 
      solution, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, and dodecylphosphocholine micelles. 
      The solution structures of nigrocin 2 in TFE/H(2)O (1:1, v/v) solution and in SDS 
      micelles were determined by homonuclear NMR. Nigrocin 2 consists of a typical 
      amphipathic alpha-helix spanning residues 3-18 in both 50% TFE solution and SDS 
      micelles. From the structural comparison of nigrocin 2 with other known 
      antimicrobial peptides, nigrocin 2 could be classified into the family of 
      antimicrobial peptides containing a single linear amphipathic alpha-helix that 
      potentially disrupts membrane integrity, which would result in cell death.

TI  - Interaction of antimicrobial peptides from Australian amphibians with lipid 
      membranes.
PG  - 107-20
AB  - Solid-state NMR and CD spectroscopy were used to study the effect of antimicrobial 
      peptides (aurein 1.2, citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1) from Australian 
      tree frogs on phospholipid membranes. 31P NMR results revealed some effect on the 
      phospholipid headgroups when the peptides interact with DMPC/DHPC 
      (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine) bicelles and aligned 
      DMPC multilayers. 2H NMR showed a small effect of the peptides on the acyl chains of 
      DMPC in bicelles or aligned multilayers, suggesting interaction with the membrane 
      surface for the shorter peptides and partial insertion for the longer peptides. 15N 
      NMR of selectively labelled peptides in aligned membranes and oriented CD spectra 
      indicated an alpha-helical conformation with helix long axis approximately 50 
      degrees to the bilayer surface at high peptide concentrations. The peptides did not 
      appear to insert deeply into PC membranes, which may explain why these positively 
      charged peptides preferentially lyse bacterial rather than eucaryotic cells.

TI  - Correlation between the activities of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and 
      hydrophobicities represented as RP HPLC retention times.
PG  - 2050-6
AB  - PTP7 is a 13-amino acid residue peptide designed from gaegurin 6, an antimicrobial 
      peptide isolated from skin secretions of Rana rugosa. In order to examine the effect 
      of hydrophobicity on antimicrobial activity, a series of PTP7 derivatives were 
      constructed and analyzed the activity against bacteria and artificial membrane. We 
      found that the mean hydrophobicity by simple summation of hydrophobicity of each 
      constituent amino acid did not necessarily describe the hydrophobic property of 
      antimicrobial peptides. The mean hydrophobicity did not show close correlation with 
      the observed hydrophobicity by measuring reverse phase high performance liquid 
      chromatography (RP HPLC) retention time. The observed hydrophobicity represented as 
      RP HPLC retention time correlated well with the activity against artificial membrane 
      and Gram positive bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus 
      epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus, rather than mean hydrophobicity. However, 
      antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, did 
      not show correlation with RP HPLC retention time. These data indicate that the RP 
      HPLC retention time should be exploited rather than the mean hydrophobicity in the 
      analysis of the relationship between hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the Japanese mountain brown frog, Rana 
      ornativentris.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - Six peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from an extract of 
      freeze-dried skin of the Japanese mountain brown frog Rana ornativentris. Two 
      structurally related peptides (brevinin-20a GLFNVFKGALKTAGKHVAGSLLNQLKCKVSGGC, 11 
      nmol/g dried tissue, and brevinin-20b GIFNVFKGALKTAGKHVAGSLLNQLKCKVSGEC, 170 nmol/g) 
      belong to the brevinin-2 family, previously identified in Asian and European, but 
      not North American, Ranid frogs. Four peptides (temporin-10a FLPLLASLFSRLL.NH2, 13 
      nmol/g; temporin-10b FLPLIGKILGTI L.NH2, 350 nmol/g; temporin-10c FLPLLASLFSRLF.NH2, 
      14 nmol/g; and temporin-10d FLPLLASLFSGLF.NH2, 8 nmol/g) are members of the temporin 
      family first identified in the European common frog Rana temporaria but also found 
      in the skins of North American Ranids. The brevinin-2 peptides showed broad-spectrum 
      activity against the gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, the 
      gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans, whereas 
      the temporins showed potent activity only against S. aureus. The brevinins and 
      temporins belong to the class of cationic antimicrobial peptides that adopt an 
      amphipathic alpha-helical conformation but it is significant that temporin-10d, 
      which lacks a basic amino acid residue, is still active against S. aureus (minimum 
      inhibitory concentration=13 microM compared with 2 microM for temporin-10a). This 
      suggests that strong electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the 
      negatively charged phospholipids of the cell membrane is not an absolute 
      prerequisite for antimicrobial activity.

TI  - Discovery of Novel Bacterial Cell-Penetrating Phylloseptins in Defensive Skin 
      Secretions of the South American Hylid Frogs, Phyllomedusa duellmani and 
      Phyllomedusa coelestis.
LID - 10.3390/toxins8090255 [doi]
LID - 255
AB  - Phylloseptin (PS) peptides, derived from South American hylid frogs (subfamily 
      Phyllomedusinae), have been found to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities 
      and relatively low haemolytic activities. Although PS peptides have been identified 
      from several well-known and widely-distributed species of the Phyllomedusinae, there 
      remains merit in their study in additional, more obscure and specialised members of 
      this taxon. Here, we report the discovery of two novel PS peptides, named PS-Du and 
      PS-Co, which were respectively identified for the first time and isolated from the 
      skin secretions of Phyllomedusa duellmani and Phyllomedusa coelestis. Their encoding 
      cDNAs were cloned, from which it was possible to deduce the entire primary 
      structures of their biosynthetic precursors. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (RP-HPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses were employed 
      to isolate and structurally-characterise respective encoded PS peptides from skin 
      secretions. The peptides had molecular masses of 2049.7 Da (PS-Du) and 1972.8 Da 
      (PS-Co). They shared typical N-terminal sequences and C-terminal amidation with 
      other known phylloseptins. The two peptides exhibited growth inhibitory activity 
      against E. coli (NCTC 10418), as a standard Gram-negative bacterium, S. aureus (NCTC 
      10788), as a standard Gram-positive bacterium and C. albicans (NCPF 1467), as a 
      standard pathogenic yeast, all as planktonic cultures. Moreover, both peptides 
      demonstrated the capability of eliminating S. aureus biofilm.

TI  - Biological characterization and modes of action of temporins and bombinins H, 
      multiple forms of short and mildly cationic anti-microbial peptides from amphibian 
      skin.
PG  - 603-13
AB  - Genetically encoded cationic anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) are essential components 
      of the ancient and non-specific innate immune system, which is the principal defence 
      mechanism of all species of life, with the primary role to kill infectious 
      microorganisms. Amphibian skin is one of the richest natural sources of such 
      molecules, which are produced by holocrine-type dermal glands and released upon 
      stimulation. This review highlights the attractive and unique structural/functional 
      properties of temporins and bombinins H, two families of short and mildly cationic 
      peptides, isolated from the skin of frogs belonging to Rana and Bombina genera, 
      respectively. Beside improving our knowledge on the role of AMPs in the regulation 
      of the innate immunity, the biological significance of the existence of multiple 
      forms of a prototypic peptide sequence within the same organism and the implication 
      of short peptides in the endotoxin neutralization, these two classes of AMPs can be 
      also considered as valid candidates for the design of novel anti-infective and 
      anti-sepsis drugs.

TI  - Anti-infection peptidomics of amphibian skin.
PG  - 882-94
AB  - Peptidomics and genomics analyses were used to study an anti-infection array of 
      peptides of amphibian skin. 372 cDNA sequences of antimicrobial peptides were 
      characterized from a single individual skin of the frog Odorrana grahami that encode 
      107 novel antimicrobial peptides. This contribution almost triples the number of 
      currently reported amphibian antimicrobial peptides. The peptides could be organized 
      into 30 divergent groups, including 24 novel groups. The diversity in peptide coding 
      cDNA sequences is, to our knowledge, the most extreme yet described for any animal. 
      The patterns of diversification suggest that point mutations as well as insertion, 
      deletion, and "shuffling" of oligonucleotide sequences were responsible for the 
      diversity. The diversity of antimicrobial peptides may have resulted from the 
      diversity of microorganisms. These diverse peptides exhibited both diverse secondary 
      structure and "host defense" properties. Such extreme antimicrobial peptide 
      diversity in a single amphibian species is amazing. This has led us to reconsider 
      the strong capability of innate immunity and molecular genetics of amphibian 
      ecological diversification and doubt the general opinion that 20-30 different 
      antimicrobial peptides can protect an animal because of the relatively wide 
      specificity of the peptide antibiotics. The antimicrobial mechanisms of O. grahami 
      peptides were investigated. They exerted their antimicrobial functions by various 
      means, including forming lamellar mesosome-like structures, peeling off the cell 
      walls, forming pores, and inducing DNA condensation. With respect to the development 
      of antibiotics, these peptides provide potential new templates to explore further.

TI  - Effect of temporin A modifications on its cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity.
PG  - 497-505
AB  - Temporin A (TA), a short alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin 
      of the frog Rana temporaria, is effective against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive 
      bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 
      vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains. TA interacts directly with the 
      cell membrane of the microorganism and it has been reported to be non-toxic to 
      erythrocytes at concentrations that are antimicrobial. Less is known about the 
      effects on the viability and growth of nucleated eukaryotic cells. In this study we 
      have tested antibacterial and growth-inhibitory properties of TA, its dimeric 
      analogue (TAd), and all-L (TAL L512) and all-D (TAD L512) enantiomeric derivatives 
      of modified TA towards S. aureus and cultured human keratinocytes, respectively. All 
      molecules were antibacterial at concentrations from 1.5 microM to 10 microM. In 
      keratinocyte cultures, TAD L512, as well as TAd, showed cytotoxicity. The original 
      TA and TAL L512 did not affect the viability of the cells at their bacteriolytic 
      concentrations. The growth of keratinocytes in low- and high-calcium media was only 
      slightly inhibited by temporins at concentrations which were antibacterial to S. 
      aureus. This suggests that original TA and its modification, TAL L512, are promising 
      molecules against multiresistant bacterial infections.

AB  - The frog skin peptides, ascaphin-8 (GFKDLLKGAAKALVKTVLF.NH(2)) and XT-7 
      (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH(2)), show broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but their 
      therapeutic potential is limited by toxicity against mammalian cells. Circular 
      dichroism spectra demonstrate that the peptides adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical 
      conformation in a membrane-mimetic solvent. This study has investigated the 
      cytolytic properties of analogs containing selected amino acid substitutions that 
      increase cationicity while maintaining amphipathicity. Substitutions at Ala(10), 
      Val(14), and Leu(18) in ascaphin-8 by either L-Lys or D-Lys produced peptides that 
      retained antimicrobial activity against the bacteria Escherichia coli and 
      Staphylococcus aureus and the opportunistic yeast pathogen, Candida albicans but 
      showed appreciably reduced toxicities (>10-fold) against human erythrocytes, HepG2 
      hepatoma-derived cells, and L929 fibroblasts. The improved therapeutic index of the 
      L-Lys(18) and D-Lys(18) analogs correlated with a decrease in % helicity and in 
      effective hydrophobicity. Substitution of Gly(4) by L-Lys in XT-7 produced an analog 
      with high potency against micro-organisms (MIC < or = 25 microM) but low cytolytic 
      activity against erythrocytes (LD(50) > 500 microM) and this increase in therapeutic 
      index also correlated with decreased helicity and hydrophobicity. Analogs of XT-7 
      with increased cationicity, containing multiple substitutions by L-Lys, not only 
      displayed increased antimicrobial potencies, particularly against Candida albicans 
      (MIC < or = 6 microM), but also increased hemolytic activities.

TI  - Novel antimicrobial cruzioseptin peptides extracted from the splendid leaf frog, 
      Cruziohyla calcarifer.
PG  - 853-868

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute part of a broad range of bioactive 
      compounds present on diverse organisms, including frogs. Peptides, produced in the 
      granular glands of amphibian skin, constitute a component of their innate immune 
      response, providing protection against pathogenic microorganisms. In this work, two 
      novel cruzioseptins peptides, cruzioseptin-16 and -17, extracted from the splendid 
      leaf frog Cruziohyla calcarifer are presented. These peptides were identified using 
      molecular cloning and tandem mass spectrometry. Later, peptides were synthetized 
      using solid-phase peptide synthesis, and their minimal inhibitory concentration and 
      haemolytic activity were tested. Furthermore, these two cruzioseptins plus three 
      previously reported (CZS-1, CZS-2, CZS-3) were computationally characterized. 
      Results show that cruzioseptins are 21-23 residues long alpha helical cationic 
      peptides, with antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans 
      and low haemolytic effect. Docking results agree with the principal action mechanism 
      of cationic AMPs that goes through cell membrane disruption due to electrostatic 
      interactions between cationic residues in the cruzioseptins and negative phosphate 
      groups in the pathogen cell membrane. An action mechanism through enzymes inhibition 
      was also tried, but no conclusive results about this mechanism were obtained.

AB  - Eight intact antimicrobial peptides were identified from the skin of Odorrana 
      jingdongensis by de novo sequencing following low energy ESI CID Q-TOF MS/MS in 
      positive-mode with the help of Edman degradation and structural similarity analysis. 
      We devised exact mass measurements to discriminate the K/Q amino acid residue in the 
      peptides between 2.0 kDa to 3.8 kDa. Moreover, the cleavage at the CS bond at the 
      side chain of Met was observed in all the spectra of the peptides containing Met 
      residue. And we found unusual cleavages within the intramolecular disulfide loop 
      with high frequency. Our data revealed that the cleavage pathways are significantly 
      different from those reported previously which are similar to the cycle peptide 
      cleavage mode followed by the secondary cleavage at the CS bond on oxidized Cys. 
      Thus, our results highly suggest that ion series generated from the cleavages within 
      the intramolecular disulfide loop should be considered in both the top-down 
      sequencing and the disulfide bridge location with the presence of a relatively high 
      intensity of MH(+)-28 ion marker. Furthermore, our activity data implied that 
      different AMPs may use different strategies to kill microbes.

TI  - Evidence for convergent evolution in the antimicrobial peptide system in anuran 
      amphibians.
PG  - 20-5
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Amphibians are characterized in part by their highly specialized and glandular skin 
      that enables key physiological functions such as cutaneous respiration and defense 
      against a variety of micro- and macroscopic predators via toxic components (e.g., 
      alkaloids and bufodienolids), biogenic amines, neuropeptides and antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs). To date, DNA sequence information regarding AMP genes in anurans is 
      restricted to only a few anuran families and largely to "higher frogs" 
      (Neobatrachia). Here, we analyze the DNA information for the signal sequences of the 
      AMP precursors in anuran amphibians available to the end of 2009 in an explicit 
      phylogenetic framework to characterize the evolution of this large, diverse gene 
      family. Comparison of cDNA sequences suggests that there are at least three 
      different motifs within the signal peptide sequence of the AMP-precursor 
      corresponding to the evolutionary lineages Neobatrachia, Bombinatoridae (Bombina 
      spp.) and Pipidae (Xenopus laevis). The signal sequences are strongly conserved 
      within each lineage (as previously noted for Neobatrachia), but highly divergent 
      between them. Together with the lack of a linear relationship between the degree of 
      sequence divergence and evolutionary time, we hypothesize that the anuran AMP system 
      has evolved convergently on at least three occasions. However, additional sampling, 
      especially among the largely poorly sampled non-neobatrachian lineages, is required 
      to confirm this hypothesis and could reveal the existence of additional signal 
      sequence motifs.

TI  - Amphibian skin peptides and their corresponding cDNAs from single lyophilized 
      secretion samples: identification of novel brevinins from three species of Chinese 
      frogs.
PG  - 42-8
AB  - Brevinins are peptides of 24 amino acid residues, originally isolated from the skin 
      of the Oriental frog, Rana brevipoda porsa, by nature of their microbicidal activity 
      against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and against strains 
      of pathogenic fungi. cDNA libraries were constructed from lyophilized skin secretion 
      of three, unstudied species of Chinese frog, Odorrana schmackeri, Odorrana 
      versabilis and Pelophylax plancyi fukienensis, using our recently developed 
      technique. In this report, we describe the "shotgun" cloning of novel brevinins by 
      means of 3'-RACE, using a "universal" degenerate primer directed towards a highly 
      conserved nucleic acid sequence domain within the 5'-untranslated region of 
      previously characterized frog skin peptide cDNAs. Novel brevinins, deduced from 
      cloned cDNA open-reading frames, were subsequently identified as mature peptides in 
      the same samples of respective species skin secretions. Bioinformatic analysis of 
      both prepro-brevinin nucleic acid sequences and translated open-reading frame amino 
      acid sequences revealed a highly conserved signal peptide domain and a hypervariable 
      anti-microbial peptide-encoding domain. The experimental approach described here can 
      thus rapidly provide robust structural data on skin anti-microbial peptides without 
      harming the donor amphibians.

TI  - Amphibian immune defenses against chytridiomycosis: impacts of changing 
      environments.
PG  - 552-62
LID - 10.1093/icb/icr095 [doi]
AB  - Eco-immunology is the field of study that attempts to understand the functions of 
      the immune system in the context of the host's environment. Amphibians are currently 
      suffering devastating declines and extinctions in nearly all parts of the world due 
      to the emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the chytrid fungus, 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Because chytridiomycosis is a skin infection and 
      remains confined to the skin, immune defenses of the skin are critical for survival. 
      Skin defenses include secreted antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulins as well as 
      antifungal metabolites produced by symbiotic skin bacteria. Low temperatures, toxic 
      chemicals, and stress inhibit the immune system and may impair natural defenses 
      against B. dendrobatidis. Tadpoles' mouth parts can be infected by B. dendrobatidis. 
      Damage to the mouth parts can impair growth, and the affected tadpoles maintain the 
      pathogen in the environment even when adults have dispersed. Newly metamorphosing 
      frogs appear to be especially vulnerable to infection and to the lethal effects of 
      this pathogen because the immune system undergoes a dramatic reorganization at 
      metamorphosis, and postmetamorphic defenses are not yet mature. Here we review our 
      current understanding of amphibian immune defenses against B. dendrobatidis and the 
      ability of the pathogen to resist those defenses. We also briefly review what is 
      known about the impacts of temperature, environmental chemicals, and stress on the 
      host-pathogen interactions and suggest future directions for research.

TI  - Identification of novel Amurin-2 variants from the skin secretion of Rana amurensis,

AB  - Rana amurensis is important in Chinese medicine as its skin secretions contain 
      abundant bioactive peptides. Here, we have identified the antimicrobial peptide 
      Amurin-2 and three highly-conserved variants, Amurin-2a, Amurin-2b and Amurin-2c 
      through a combination of molecular cloning and MS/MS fragmentation sequencing. 
      Synthetic replicates of these peptides demonstrate potent antimicrobial activity 
      against S. aureus, whilst some have activity against C.albicans and even resistant 
      bacterial MRSA. Furthermore, two Lys-analogues (K(4)-Amurin-2 and K(11)-Amurin-2) 
      were designed to improve the bioactive function and the antimicrobial activity of 
      K(4)-Amurin-2 against E.coli was enhanced distinctly. In addition, the two modified 
      peptides also showed more potent activity against S. aureus, C. albicans and MRSA 
      strains. Meanwhile, these peptides showed inhibitory effect on the cell viability of 
      several cancer cells. As a result, these structural and functional studies of 
      Amurin-2 variants and analogues could provide insights for future antimicrobial 
      peptide design.

TI  - A New Family of Diverse Skin Peptides from the Microhylid Frog Genus Phrynomantis.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25040912 [doi]
LID - 912
AB  - A wide range of frogs produce skin poisons composed of bioactive peptides for 
      defence against pathogens, parasites and predators. While several frog families have 
      been thoroughly screened for skin-secreted peptides, others, like the Microhylidae, 
      have remained mostly unexplored. Previous studies of microhylids found no evidence 
      of peptide secretion, suggesting that this defence adaptation was evolutionarily 
      lost. We conducted transcriptome analyses of the skins of Phrynomantis bifasciatus 
      and Phrynomantis microps, two African microhylid species long suspected to be 
      poisonous. Our analyses reveal 17 evolutionary related transcripts that diversified 
      from to those of cytolytic peptides found in other frog families. The 19 peptides 
      predicted to be processed from these transcripts, named phrynomantins, show a 
      striking structural diversity that is distinct from any previously identified frog 
      skin peptide. Functional analyses of five phrynomantins confirm the loss of a 
      cytolytic function and the absence of insecticidal or proinflammatory activity, 
      suggesting that they represent an evolutionary transition to a new, yet unknown 
      function. Our study shows that peptides have been retained in the defence poison of 
      at least one microhylid lineage and encourages research on similarly understudied 
      taxa to further elucidate the diversity and evolution of skin defence molecules.

TI  - Ranacyclins, a new family of short cyclic antimicrobial peptides: biological 
      function, mode of action, and parameters involved in target specificity.
PG  - 14023-35
AB  - We report on two new cyclic 17-residue peptides that we named ranacyclins E and T, 
      the first isolated from Rana esculenta frog skin secretions and the second 
      discovered by screening a cDNA library from Rana temporaria. Ranacyclins have a loop 
      region that is homologous with that of an 18-mer peptide, pLR, isolated from the 
      skin of the Northern Leopard frog, Rana pipiens, with no reported antimicrobial 
      activity. Here we show that ranacyclins and pLR have antimicrobial and antifungal 
      activity. However, despite the high structural similarity, they differ in their 
      spectrum of activity. The data reveal that ranacyclins and pLR have several 
      properties that differentiate them from most known antimicrobial peptides. These 
      include the following: (i) they adopt a significant portion of random coil structure 
      in the membrane as revealed by ATR-FTIR and CD spectroscopy (50% for ranacyclin T 
      and 70% for both ranacyclin E and pLR); (ii) they bind similarly to both 
      zwitterionic and negatively charged membranes as revealed by using tryptophan 
      fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance (SPR; BIAcore biosensor); (iii) they 
      insert into the hydrophobic core of the membrane and presumably form transmembrane 
      pores without damage to the bacterial wall, as revealed by SPR, ATR-FTIR, and 
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and (iv) despite being highly and equally 
      active in permeating bacterial spheroplasts and negatively charged membranes, they 
      differ significantly in their potencies against target cells. Furthermore, a 
      significant fraction of a given secondary structure is not prerequisite for membrane 
      permeation and antimicrobial activity. However, increasing the fraction of a 
      secondary structure and reducing peptide assembly in the membrane make it easier for 
      the peptide to diffuse through the cell wall, which is different for each 
      microorganism, into the cytoplasmic membrane.

LID - 10.1016/j.ygeno.2009.09.004 [doi]
AB  - Much attention has been paid on amphibian peptides for their wide-ranging 
      pharmacological properties, clinical potential, and gene-encoded origin. More than 
      300 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from amphibians have been studied. Peptidomics and 
      genomics analysis combined with functional test including microorganism killing, 
      histamine-releasing, and mast cell degranulation was used to investigate 
      antimicrobial peptide diversity. Thirty-four novel AMPs from skin secretions of Rana 
      nigrovittata were identified in current work, and they belong to 9 families, 
      including 6 novel families. Other three families are classified into rugosin, 
      gaegurin, and temporin family of amphibian AMP, respectively. These AMPs share 
      highly conserved preproregions including signal peptides and spacer acidic peptides, 
      while greatly diversified on mature peptides structures. In this work, peptidomics 
      combined with genomics analysis was confirmed to be an effective way to identify 
      amphibian AMPs, especially novel families. Some AMPs reported here will provide 
      leading molecules for designing novel antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Evaluating the effect of dermaseptin S4 and its derivatives on multidrug-resistant 
      bacterial strains and on the colon cancer cell line SW620.

AB  - Dermaseptins are peptides found in the skin secretions of Phyllomedusinae frogs. 
      These peptides exert a lytic action on various microorganisms and have no 
      considerable hemolytic effect except dermaseptin S4 (DS4) which exhibits a powerful 
      cytotoxic effect. Therefore, we synthesized several analogs of DS4 in an attempt to 
      find molecules with a weak hemolytic effect and significant bioactivities. In this 
      study, we performed the synthesis of truncated peptides by introducing C-terminal 
      and N-terminal amino acid deletions of the native sequence. All peptide analogs, in 
      comparison with parental peptide, were tested firstly on human red blood cells to 
      work out their cytotoxicity, secondly on the multidrug-resistant bacteria by trying 
      to find MICs, and finally on colon cancer tumor cell line SW620 using the MTT test 
      so as to investigate the anti-proliferative effect. Our results showed that, on the 
      one hand, the N terminus of the native peptide was necessary for the antibacterial 
      activity and the anti-proliferative effect of the peptide. On the other hand, the 
      hemolytic activity was more notable in the sequences broken down on the C-terminal 
      side.

AB  - Morphological evidence and data from comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 
      mitochondrial genes demonstrate considerable intraspecies variation among 
      populations of the Japanese brown frog Rana tagoi Okada 1928 (Tago's brown frog). 
      Five peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from an extract of the skins 
      of specimens of Rana tagoi okiensis collected on the Oki Islands, Japan. 
      Determination of their primary structures demonstrated that two peptides belong to 
      the ranatuerin-2 family, two peptides to the temporin family, and one peptide to the 
      brevinin-1 family. Ranatuerin-2 peptides were not previously identified in the skin 
      of specimens of R. t. tagoi collected in Chiba Prefecture, Japan and the structures 
      of the temporin peptides from R. t. okiensis (temporin-TOa: FLPILGKLLSGFL.NH(2) and 
      temporin-TOb: FLPILGKLLSGLL.NH(2)) are different from temporin-TGa 
      (FLPILGKLLSGIL.NH(2)) isolated from R. t. tagoi. Similarly, the acyclic C-terminally 
      alpha-amidated brevinin-1 peptide from R. t. okiensis (Brevinin-1TOa, 
      GIGSILGVIAKGLPTLISWIKNR.NH(2)) shows three amino acid substitutions (Gly(1)-->Ala, 
      Val(8)-->Ala, Ile(9)-->Leu) compared to the ortholog from R. t. tagoi. In addition, 
      bradykinin, identical to the mammalian peptide, is present in high concentration in 
      the skin of R. t. okiensis but not R. t. tagoi. The data provide evidence to support 
      the proposal that R. t. tagoi and R. t. okiensis should be regarded as separate 
      species (R. tagoi and R. okiensis) rather than conspecific subspecies.

TI  - Skin peptides of different life stages of Ewing's tree frog.
PG  - 532-7
LID - 10.1002/jez.582 [doi]
AB  - In frogs, an important mechanism of skin innate immunity against invading microbial 
      pathogens is secretion of antimicrobial peptides from the specialized granular 
      glands. Since these glands develop fully in skin dermis after completion of 
      metamorphosis, they are small and immature in skin of larvae (tadpoles). Skin 
      secretions vary among different life stages. Antimicrobial activity and peptide 
      composition of natural mixture of skin peptides of three different life stages of 
      New Zealand Ewing's Tree Frog (Litoria ewingii), tadpoles, metamorphs and adults 
      were analyzed. The peptide mixtures were collected from skin secretions and analyzed 
      for activity against the standard reference bacterium, Escherichia coli (ATCC 
      25922). Their peptide components were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS). The peptide mixture from adults and metamorphs contained the 
      species-specific antimicrobial peptide uperin 7.1 and inhibited the growth of E. 
      coli (ATCC 25922). In contrast, the peptide mixture of tadpoles did not inhibit the 
      growth of E. coli (ATCC 25922). This peptide mixture did not contain uperin 7.1 but 
      had peptides whose molecular masses did not correspond to molecular masses of any 
      known frog antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - The first identified cathelicidin from tree frogs possesses anti-inflammatory and 
      partial LPS neutralization activities.
PG  - 1571-1585
LID - 10.1007/s00726-017-2449-7 [doi]
AB  - As of February 2017, approximately 7639 amphibian species have been described in the 
      AmphibiaWeb database. However, only 20 cathelicidin-like antimicrobial peptides have 
      been identified to date from 10 amphibian species. Half of these peptides were 
      identified from genome sequences and have not yet been functionally characterized. 
      In this study, a novel cathelicidin-like peptide designated cathelicidin-PP was 
      purified from the skin of tree frog Polypedates puerensis. Cathelicidin-PP is a 32 
      residue peptide of sequence ASENGKCNLLCLVKKKLRAVGNVIKTVVGKIA. Circular dichroism 
      spectroscopy indicated that cathelicidin-PP mainly adopts a β-sheet structure in 
      membrane-mimetic solutions. Cathelicidin-PP exhibits potent antimicrobial activity 
      against bacteria and fungi, especially Gram-negative bacteria. Meanwhile, it shows 
      low cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. Scanning electron microscopy analysis 
      indicated that cathelicidin-PP kills bacteria through the disruption of the 
      bacterial cell membrane integrity. Furthermore, cathelicidin-PP exerts significant 
      anti-inflammatory functions by inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated 
      generation of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
      interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6. The MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) and NF-κB signaling 
      pathways are involved in the anti-inflammatory effect. Cathelicidin-PP caused 
      partial neutralization of LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative PCR indicated 
      that infection of tree frogs with bacteria causes increased expression of 
      cathelicidin-PP in immune-related tissues. Taken together, cathelicidin-PP is the 
      first identified cathelicidin-like peptide from tree frogs. Our findings demonstrate 
      that in addition to direct bactericidal capacity, cathelicidin-PP also possesses 
      immunomodulatory properties, including partial neutralization of LPS, and inhibiting 
      the production of inflammatory cytokines.

TI  - Evidence that the genes encoding the melittin-related peptides in the skins of the 
      Japanese frogs Rana sakuraii and Rana tagoi are not orthologous to bee venom 
      melittin genes: developmental- and tissue-dependent gene expression.
PG  - 2061-8
AB  - The antimicrobial melittin-related peptides (MRPs) isolated from skin extracts of 
      the Japanese frogs, Rana sakuraii and Rana tagoi, show amino acid sequence 
      similarity with melittin from the venom of honeybees but the evolutionary 
      relationship between the amphibian and insect peptides is unknown. cDNA clones 
      encoding the MRP precursor (preproMRP) were obtained from R. sakuraii and R. tagoi 
      skin total RNA. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the clones 
      indicated that the preproMRPs are organized like typical amphibian antimicrobial 
      peptide precursors, with a highly conserved signal peptide, a more variable 
      intervening sequence, and a hypervariable mature peptide region. This organization 
      is markedly different from that of prepromelittin, in which the melittin sequence is 
      flanked by multiple Xaa-Pro and Xaa-Ala dipeptides. The data indicate, therefore, 
      that the genes encoding frog skin MRPs are not orthologous to the genes encoding 
      melittins from bee venom. In adult R. sakuraii specimens, preproMRP gene transcripts

      stomach, small intestine, or liver. In R. tagoi, preproMRP mRNA was not detected in 
      skin prior to the onset of metamorphosis, but its level increased markedly during 
      metamorphosis reaching a maximum at the stages of metamorphic climax.

AB  - Amphibians worldwide continue to battle an emerging infectious disease, 
      chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Southern leopard 
      frogs, Rana sphenocephala, are known to become infected with this pathogen, yet they 
      are considered 'of least concern' for declines due to chytridiomycosis. Previous 
      studies have shown that R. sphenocephala secretes four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      onto their skin which may play an important role in limiting susceptibility to 
      chytridiomycosis. Here, we examined (1) the effects of temperature and AMP depletion 
      on infections with Bd and (2) the effects of temperature and Bd infection on the 
      capacity to secrete AMPs in juvenile leopard frogs. Pathogen burden and mortality 
      were greater in frogs exposed to Bd at low temperature but did not increase 
      following monthly AMP depletion. Both low temperature and Bd exposure reduced the 
      capacity of juvenile frogs to restore peptides after monthly depletions. Frogs held 
      at 14°C were poorly able to restore peptides in comparison with those at 26°C. Frogs 
      held at 26°C were better able to restore their peptides, but when exposed to Bd, 
      this capacity was significantly reduced. These results strongly support the 
      hypothesis that both colder temperatures and Bd infection impair the capacity of 
      juvenile frogs to produce and secrete AMPs, an important component of their innate 
      defense against chytrid fungi and other pathogens. Thus, in the face of 
      unpredictable climate changes and enzootic pathogens, assessments of disease risk 
      should consider the potential for effects of environmental variation and pathogen 
      exposure on the quality of host defenses.

      activities against Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Brevinin-GR23 (B-GR23) was a brevinin-2 like antimicrobial peptide, which had 
      antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) of 16 μM. B-GR23 increased the bacterial membrane permeation, 
      leading to the damage of membrane integrity and the leakage of genomic DNA, then 
      causing the cell death. The peptide nearly inhibited all plantonic bacteria to start 
      the initial attachment of biofilm at the concentration of 1 × MIC. Whereas the 
      disruption rates on immature and mature biofilm decreased from 60% to 20%. B-GR23 
      reduced the production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in the planktonic 
      growth of S. aureus, which is a crucial structure of biofilm formation. B-GR23 with 
      the concentration of ½ × MIC inhibited 50% water-soluble EPS, and 48% 
      water-insoluble EPS, which contributed to the antibiofilm activity. B-GR23 had no 
      significant toxicity to human blood cells under-tested concentration (200 μM), 
      making it a potential template for designing antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Bioevaluation of Ranatuerin-2Pb from the Frog Skin Secretion of Rana pipiens and its 
      Truncated Analogues.
LID - 10.3390/biom9060249 [doi]
LID - 249
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as a promising agent to overcome the 
      drug-resistance of bacteria. Large numbers of AMPs have been identified from the 
      skin secretion of Rana pipiens, including brevinins, ranatuerins, temporins and 
      esculentins. In this study, the cDNA precursor of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
      peptide, ranatuerin-2Pb, was cloned and identified. Additionally, two truncated 
      analogues, RPa and RPb, were synthesised to investigate the structure-activity 
      relationship of ranatuerin-2Pb. RPa lost antimicrobial activity against Candida 
      albicans, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while RPb retained 
      its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Additionally, ranatuerin-2Pb, RPa and RPb 
      demonstrated inhibition and eradication effects against Staphylococcus aureus 
      biofilm. RPb showed a rapid bacterial killing manner via membrane permeabilization 
      without damaging the cell membrane of erythrocytes. Moreover, RPb decreased the 
      mortality of S. aureus infected Galleria mellonella larvae. Collectively, our 
      results suggested that RPb may pave a novel way for natural antimicrobial drug 
      design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporins are small antimicrobial peptides secreted by the Rana 
      temporaria showing mainly activity against Gram-positive bacteria. However, 
      different members of the temporin family, such as Temporin B, act in synergy also 
      against Gram-negative bacteria. With the aim to develop a peptide with a wide 
      spectrum of antimicrobial activity we designed and analyzed a series of Temporin B 
      analogs. METHODS: Peptides were initially obtained by Ala scanning on Temporin B 
      sequence; antimicrobial activity tests allowed to identify the TB_G6A sequence, 
      which was further optimized by increasing the peptide positive charge (TB_KKG6A). 
      Interactions of this active peptide with the LPS of E. coli were investigated by CD, 
      fluorescence and NMR. RESULTS: TB_KKG6A is active against Gram-positive and 
      Gram-negative bacteria at low concentrations. The peptide strongly interacts with 
      the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and folds upon interaction into a kinked helix. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results show that it is possible to widen the activity spectrum of 
      an antimicrobial peptide by subtle changes of the primary structure. TB_KKG6A, 
      having a simple composition, a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and a very 
      low hemolytic activity, is a promising candidate for the design of novel 
      antimicrobial peptides. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The activity of antimicrobial peptides 
      is strongly related to the ability of the peptide to interact and break the 
      bacterial membrane. Our studies on TB_KKG6A indicate that efficient interactions 
      with LPS can be achieved when the peptide is not perfectly amphipathic, since this 
      feature seems to help the toroidal pore formation process.

AB  - A previous review summarized research prior to 2004 carried out on the bioactive 
      host-defense peptides contained in the skin secretions of Australian anurans (frogs 
      and toads). This review covers the extension of that research from 2004 to 2012, and 
      includes membrane-active peptides (including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal 
      and antiviral peptides) together with the mechanisms by which these peptides 
      interact with model membranes, peptides that may be classified as "neuropeptides" 
      (including smooth muscle active peptides, opioids and immunomodulators) and peptides 
      which inhibit the formation of nitric oxide from neuronal nitric oxide synthase. The 
      review discusses the outcome of cDNA sequencing of signal-spacer-active peptides 
      from an evolutionary viewpoint, and also lists those peptides for which activities 
      have not been found to this time.

TI  - Inactivation of viruses infecting ectothermic animals by amphibian and piscine 
      antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 268-75
AB  - The ability of five purified amphibian antimicrobial peptides (dermaseptin-1, 
      temporin A, magainin I, and II, PGLa), crude peptide fractions isolated from the 
      skin of Rana pipiens and R. catesbeiana, and four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from 
      hybrid striped bass (piscidin-1N, -1H, -2, and -3) were examined for their ability 
      to reduce the infectivity of channel catfish virus (CCV) and frog virus 3 (FV3). All 
      compounds, with the exception of magainin I, markedly reduced the infectivity of 
      CCV. In contrast to CCV, FV3 was 2- to 4-fold less sensitive to these agents. 
      Similar to an earlier study employing two other amphibian peptides, the agents used 
      here acted rapidly and over a wide, physiologically relevant, temperature range to 
      reduce virus infectivity. These results extend our previous findings and strongly 
      suggest that various amphibian and piscine AMPs may play important roles in 
      protecting fish and amphibians from pathogenic viruses.

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding biosynthetic precursors for 
      the antimicrobial peptides japonicin-1Ja, japonicin-2Ja, and temporin-1Ja in the 
      Japanese brown frog, Rana japonica.
PG  - 339-47
LID - 10.2108/zsj.28.339 [doi]
AB  - Using a combination of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and the 5'- 
      and/or 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we cloned, from a Japanese brown frog 
      (Rana japonica) skin total RNA preparation, cDNAs encoding biosynthetic precursors 
      for the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) japonicin-1Ja (FFPIGVFCKIFKTC), japonicin-2Ja 
      (FGLPMLSILPKALCILLKRKC), and temporin-1Ja (ILPLVGNLLNDLL.NH2). These peptides were 
      previously isolated from an extract of R. japonica skin. The present study is the 
      first report to describe the molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding a japonicin-2 
      family peptide. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analyses revealed 
      that the hypothetical precursor protein of japonicin-2Ja, as well as japonicin-1Ja 
      and temporin-1Ja, is organized similarly to those of typical amphibian AMP 
      precursors, with a highly conserved signal peptide, a relatively well conserved 
      intervening sequence, and a hypervariable AMP mature region. Antimicrobial assays 
      for synthetic replicates of cyclic and linear japonicin-2Ja revealed that the 
      intramolecular disulfide bond is necessary for activity. A semi-quantitative 
      analysis by real-time RTPCR using TaqMan probes revealed that the relative values of 
      preprojaponicin-2Ja mRNA expression levels in the skin, skeletal muscle of hind leg, 
      kidney, testis, small intestine, and stomach total RNA sample specimens in adult R. 
      japonica were 6.5×10(5), 9.6, 2.0, 1.6, 1.6, and 1.0, respectively. The presence of 
      preprojaponicin-2Ja mRNAs in the cytoplasm of glandular cells in R. japonica dorsal 
      skin glands was demonstrated by means of in situ hybridization using 
      digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes for the precursor.

TI  - Effects of chytrid and carbaryl exposure on survival, growth and skin peptide 
      defenses in foothill yellow-legged frogs.
PG  - 1771-6
AB  - Environmental contaminants and disease may synergistically contribute to amphibian 
      population declines. Sub-lethal levels of contaminants can suppress amphibian immune 
      defenses and, thereby, may facilitate disease outbreaks. We conducted laboratory 
      experiments on newly metamorphosed foothill yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii) to 
      determine whether sublethal exposure to the pesticide carbaryl would increase 
      susceptibility to the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis that 
      is widely associated with amphibian declines. We examined the effect of carbaryl 
      alone, chytrid alone, and interactions of the two on individual survival, growth, 
      and antimicrobial skin defenses. We found no effect of chytrid, carbaryl, or their 
      interaction on survival. However, chytrid infection reduced growth by approximately 
      one-half. This is the first report of suppressed growth in post-metamorphic 
      amphibians due to infection with chytrid. Rana boylii skin peptides strongly 
      inhibited chytrid growth in vitro, which may explain why chytrid exposure did not 
      result in significant mortality. Skin peptide defenses were significantly reduced 
      after exposure to carbaryl suggesting that pesticides may inhibit this innate immune 
      defense and increase susceptibility to disease.

TI  - Three novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin of the Indian bronzed frog Hylarana 
      temporalis (Anura: Ranidae).
PG  - 342-7
LID - 10.1002/psc.1363 [doi]
AB  - Amphibian skin secretion is considered as a rich source of bioactive peptides. The 
      present work describes the successful identification of three novel peptides named 
      brevinin-1TEa, brevinin-2TEa and brevinin-2TEb present in the skin secretion of 
      Indian bronzed frog Hylarana temporalis. The deduced open reading frame encoding the 
      biosynthetic precursor of brevinin-1TEa consisted of 70 amino acid residues and 
      brevinin-2TEa and brevinin-2TEb consisted of 71 and 72 amino acids, respectively. 
      All the three peptides showed higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative 
      than against Gram-positive bacteria. On the basis of the antibacterial and 
      haemolytic activity, brevinin-2TEb is the most potent peptide reported in the 
      present study. Further research on these peptides may provide potential clue towards 
      newer drug development to combat various microbial diseases.

TI  - Micelle Bound Structure and Model Membrane Interaction Studies of the Peptide Hylin 
      a1 from the Arboreal South American Frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus.
PG  - 719-26
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) appear as a promising therapeutic candidate against 
      multiresistant pathogens, because they are able to kill microorganisms and have low 
      toxicity of resistance cells. Hylin a1 (Hy-a1, IFGAILPLALGALKNLIK-NH2) is a peptide 
      extracted from the skin secretion of the frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus, which 
      displays antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. We report here structural studies 
      of Hy-a1 using different techniques such as fluorescence, CD and NMR. Our data 
      showed that Hy-a1 acquires a well defined amphipathic α-helix when interacting with 
      a membrane-like environment. Furthermore, Hy-a1 presented different affinity when 
      compared to membranes of zwitterionic or anionic lipid composition. Finally, we 
      proposed a molecular interaction model of this peptide with micelles.

TI  - Role of proline, cysteine and a disulphide bridge in the structure and activity of 
      the anti-microbial peptide gaegurin 5.
PG  - 171-82
AB  - Gaegurin 5 (GGN5) is a cationic 24-residue anti-microbial peptide isolated from the 
      skin of a Korean frog, Rana rugosa. It contains a central proline residue and an 
      intra-residue disulphide bridge in its C-terminus, which are common to the 
      anti-microbial peptides found in Ranidae. We determined the solution structure of 
      GGN5 bound to SDS micelles for the first time and investigated the role of proline, 
      cysteine and a disulphide bridge on the structure and activity of GGN5. GGN5 adopts 
      an amphipathic alpha-helical structure spanning residues 3-20 kinked around Pro-14, 
      which allows the hydrophobic residues to reside in the concave helical region, and a 
      disulphide-bridged loop-like conformation in its C-terminus. By replacement of 
      proline with alanine (PAGGN5), a straight and rigid helix was formed in the central 
      region and was more stable than the kinked helix. Reduction of a disulphide bridge 
      in the C-terminus (GGN5SH) maintained the loosely ordered loop-like conformation, 
      while the replacement of two cysteines with serines (CSGGN5) caused the C-terminal 
      conformation to be completely disordered. The magnitude of anti-microbial activity 
      of the peptides was closely related to their helical stability in the order 
      PAGGN5>GGN5>GGN5SH>CSGGN5, suggesting that the helical stability of the peptides is 
      important for anti-microbial activity. On the other hand, the significant increase 
      of haemolytic activity of PAGGN5 implies that a helical kink of GGN5 could be 
      involved in the selectivity of target cells. The location of GGN5 and PAGGN5, 
      analysed using paramagnetic probes, was mainly at the surface of SDS micelles, 
      although the location of the N-terminal region was slightly different between them.

TI  - The first anionic defensin from amphibians.
PG  - 1301-8
LID - 10.1007/s00726-015-1963-8 [doi]
AB  - A variety of antimicrobial peptides against infection have been identified from the 
      skin of amphibians. However, knowledge on amphibian defensins is very limited. A 
      novel anionic defensin designated PopuDef was purified from the skin of tree frog 
      Polypedates puerensis, and the cDNA encoding PopuDef precursor was cloned from the 
      skin cDNA library. The amino acid sequence of PopuDef (net charge: -2, pI: 4.75) 
      shared the highest identity of 57 % (25/44) with the salamander defensin CFBD-1 (net 
      charge: 0, pI: 6.14) from urodela amphibians. PopuDef showed moderate antimicrobial 
      activities against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (MICs are 19.41 and 17.25 μM, 
      respectively), and relatively weak activities against E. coli and B. subtilis (MICs 
      are 38.82 and 43.14 μM, respectively). Tissue distribution analysis indicated that 
      relatively high expression level of PopuDef mRNA was observed in immune-related 
      tissues including skin, gut, lung and spleen. Furthermore, the expression level of 
      PopuDef was significantly upregulated in these tissues after tree frogs were 
      infected with different bacteria strains mentioned above. Interestingly, the 
      induction of PopuDef challenged with E. coli or B. subtilis, which was less 
      sensitive to PopuDef, was much higher than that did with P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. 
      These findings highlight the key role of PopuDef in innate immunity against 
      infection. To our knowledge, PopuDef is the first anionic defensin characterized 
      from amphibians.

TI  - Bacteria May Cope Differently from Similar Membrane Damage Caused by the Australian 
      Tree Frog Antimicrobial Peptide Maculatin 1.1.
PG  - 19853-62
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.643262 [doi]
AB  - Maculatin 1.1 (Mac1) is an antimicrobial peptide from the skin of Australian tree 
      frogs and is known to possess selectivity toward Gram-positive bacteria. Although 
      Mac1 has membrane disrupting activity, it is not known how Mac1 selectively targets 
      Gram-positive over Gram-negative bacteria. The interaction of Mac1 with Escherichia 
      coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and human red blood cells (hRBC) and with their mimetic 
      model membranes is here reported. The peptide showed a 16-fold greater growth 
      inhibition activity against S. aureus (4 μM) than against E. coli (64 μM) and an 
      intermediate cytotoxicity against hRBC (30 μM). Surprisingly, Sytox Green uptake 
      monitored by flow cytometry showed that Mac1 compromised both bacterial membranes 
      with similar efficiency at ∼20-fold lower concentration than the reported minimum 
      inhibition concentration against S. aureus. Mac1 also reduced the negative potential 
      of S. aureus and E. coli membrane with similar efficacy. Furthermore, liposomes 
      mimicking the cell membrane of S. aureus (POPG/TOCL) and E. coli (POPE/POPG) were 
      lysed at similar concentrations, whereas hRBC-like vesicles (POPC/SM/Chol) remained 
      mostly intact in the presence of Mac1. Remarkably, when POPG/TOCL and POPE/POPG 
      liposomes were co-incubated, Mac1 did not induce leakage from POPE/POPG liposomes, 
      suggesting a preference toward POPG/TOCL membranes that was supported by surface 
      plasma resonance assays. Interestingly, circular dichroism spectroscopy showed a 
      similar helical conformation in the presence of the anionic liposomes but not the 
      hRBC mimics. Overall, the study showed that Mac1 disrupts bacterial membranes in a 
      similar fashion before cell death events and would preferentially target S. aureus 
      over E. coli or hRBC membranes.

TI  - Purification, characterization and homology analysis of ocellatin 4, a cytolytic 
      peptide from the skin secretion of the frog Leptodactylus ocellatus.
PG  - 1095-104
AB  - Neobatrachia is the amphibian suborder with the largest number of species and a most 
      important source of bioactive peptides from frog skin secretions. However, 90% of 
      the studies on this subject have been focused on the frog families Hylidae and 
      Ranidae, while very little is known about peptides of other families, like 
      Leptodactylidae. Our work reports for the first time the isolation and 
      characterization of ocellatin 4 (GLLDFVTGVGKDIFAQLIKQI-NH(2)), a cytolytic peptide 
      from the skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus ocellatus. While 
      most cytolytic amphibian skin peptides are selective for microorganisms and harmless 
      for mammalian cells, the HC(50) of ocellatin 4 against human erythrocytes is 
      14.3muM. The interaction between ocellatin 4 and zwitterionic phospholipids in 
      mammalian plasma membranes may be favored by its neutral charge at pH 7.0. Ocellatin 
      4 also shows some antibacterial activity (MICs(E. coli)(and)(S. aureus)=64muM) and 
      its sequence shares similarities with the only six leptodactylid peptides previously 
      known and with four peptides from Australian hylid frogs of the genus Litoria.

TI  - Peptidomic analysis of skin secretions supports separate species status for the 
      tailed frogs, Ascaphus truei and Ascaphus montanus.
PG  - 121-5
LID - 10.1016/j.cbd.2007.01.003 [doi]
AB  - The tailed frog Ascaphus truei Stejneger, 1899 is the most primitive extant anuran 
      and the sister taxon to the clade of all other living frogs. The species occupies 
      two disjunct ranges in the Northwest region of North America: the Cascade Mountains 
      and coastal area from British Columbia to Northern California, and an inland range 
      in the northern Rocky Mountains and the Blue and Wallowa mountains. A previous study 
      led to the isolation of eight peptides with antimicrobial activity (termed the 
      ascaphins) from skin secretions of A. truei from the coastal range. The present 
      study has used peptidomic analysis to identify the products of orthologous ascaphin 
      genes in electrically-stimulated skin secretions from inland range specimens. 
      Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that ascaphins from the 
      inland range contained the following amino acid substitutions compared with 
      orthologs from the coastal range frogs: ascaphin-1 (Ala(12)-->Glu), ascaphin-3 
      (Asp(4)-->Glu), ascaphin-4 (Ala(19)-->Ser), ascaphin-5 (Lys(12)-->Thr), and 
      ascaphin-7 (Gly(8)-->Ser and Ser(20)-->Asn). Orthologs of ascaphins-2, -6, and -8 
      were not identified but a paralog of ascaphin-5, identical to ascaphin-5 from 
      coastal range frogs, was found. The data support the claims, derived from analysis 
      of the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes, that the inland populations of 
      the tailed frog should be recognized as a distinct species, the Rocky Mountain 
      tailed frog Ascaphus montanus and that the divergence of the species from A. truei 
      probably occurred in the late Miocene (approximately 10 Mya).

TI  - Identification and Target-Modification of SL-BBI: A Novel Bowman-Birk Type Trypsin 
      Inhibitor from Sylvirana latouchii.
LID - 10.3390/biom10091254 [doi]
LID - 1254
AB  - The peptides from the ranacyclin family share similar active disulphide loop with 
      plant-derived Bowman-Birk type inhibitors, some of which have the dual activities of 
      trypsin inhibition and antimicrobial. Herein, a novel Bowman-Birk type trypsin 
      inhibitor of the ranacyclin family was identified from the skin secretion of 
      broad-folded frog (Sylvirana latouchii) by molecular cloning method and named as 
      SL-BBI. After chemical synthesis, it was proved to be a potent inhibitor of trypsin 
      with a Ki value of 230.5 nM and showed weak antimicrobial activity against tested 
      microorganisms. Modified analogue K-SL maintains the original inhibitory activity 
      with a Ki value of 77.27 nM while enhancing the antimicrobial activity. After the 
      substitution of active P1 site to phenylalanine and P2' site to isoleucine, F-SL 
      regenerated its inhibitory activity on chymotrypsin with a Ki value of 309.3 nM and 
      exhibited antiproliferative effects on PC-3, MCF-7 and a series of non-small cell 
      lung cancer cell lines without cell membrane damage. The affinity of F-SL for the β 
      subunits in the yeast 20S proteasome showed by molecular docking simulations 
      enriched the understanding of the possible action mode of Bowman-Birk type 
      inhibitors. Further mechanistic studies have shown that F-SL can activate caspase 
      3/7 in H157 cells and induce apoptosis, which means it has the potential to become 
      an anticancer agent.

AB  - Six structurally similar and strongly cationic peptides belonging to the brevinin-1 
      family were isolated from skin secretions of the plains leopard frog Lithobates 
      blairi and the lowland leopard frog Lithobates yavapaiensis on the basis of their 
      antimicrobial activities. Brevinin-1BLc (FLPIIAGIAAKFLPKIFCTISKKC) from L. blairi 
      represented the most potent peptide (MIC=25microM Escherichia coli, MIC=1.5microM 
      Staphylococcus aureus, MIC=3microM Candida albicans, LC(50)=9microM human 
      erythrocytes and LC(50)=6microM HepG2 human hepatoma-derived cells). The appreciably 
      lower antimicrobial potencies of brevinin-1Ya and -1Yc from L. yavapaiensis 
      correlate with the decreases in cationicity produced by the amino acid substitutions 
      Lys(11)-->Asn (brevinin-1Ya) and Pro(14)-->Glu (brevinin-1Yc). In addition, a 
      peptide isolated from the skin secretions of L. yavapaiensis belonging to the 
      ranatuerin-2 family (ranatuerin-2Ya; GLMDTIKGVAKTVAASWLDKLKCKIT GC) inhibited the 
      growth of E. coli (MIC=50microM) and S. aureus (MIC=50microM). In contrast to 
      brevinin-1BLc, ranatuerin-2Ya showed appreciably greater cytolytic activity against 
      HepG2 cells (LC(50)=20microM) than against erythrocytes (LC(50)>100microM).

TI  - Somuncurins: Bioactive Peptides from the Skin of the Endangered Endemic Patagonian 
      Frog Pleurodema somuncurense.
PG  - 972-984
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b00906 [doi]
AB  - The skin glands of amphibian species hold a major component of their innate 
      immunity, namely a unique set of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Although most of 
      them have common characteristics, differences in AMP sequences allow a huge 
      repertoire of biological activity with varying degrees of efficacy. We present the 
      first study of the AMPs from Pleurodema somuncurence (Anura: Leptodactylidae: 
      Leiuperinae). Among the 11 identified mature peptides, three presented antimicrobial 
      activity. Somuncurin-1 (FIIWPLRYRK), somuncurin-2 (FILKRSYPQYY), and thaulin-3 
      (NLVGSLLGGILKK) inhibited Escherichia coli growth. Somuncurin-1 also showed 
      antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Biophysical membrane model 
      studies revealed that this peptide had a greater permeation effect in 
      prokaryotic-like membranes and capacity to restructure liposomes, suggesting 
      fusogenic activity, which could lead to cell aggregation and disruption of cell 
      morphology. This study contributes to the characterization of peptides with new 
      sequences to enrich the databases for the design of therapeutic agents. Furthermore, 
      it highlights the importance of investing in nature conservation and the power of 
      genetic description as a strategy to identify new compounds.

TI  - Tigerinin-1R: a potent, non-toxic insulin-releasing peptide isolated from the skin 
      of the Asian frog, Hoplobatrachus rugulosus.
PG  - 1114-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01470.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Characterization of peptides in the skin of the Vietnamese common lowland frog 
      Hoplobatrachus rugulosus with the ability to stimulate insulin release in vitro and 
      improve glucose tolerance in vivo. METHODS: Peptides in an extract of skin were 
      purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and their abilities to stimulate the release of 
      insulin and the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase were determined using 
      BRIN-BD11 clonal β cells. Insulin-releasing potencies of synthetic peptides and 
      their effects on membrane potential and intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration were also 
      measured using BRIN-BD11 cells. Effects on glucose tolerance and insulin release in 
      vivo were determined in mice fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity and insulin 
      resistance. RESULTS: A cyclic dodecapeptide (RVCSAIPLPICH.NH₂), termed tigerinin-1R, 
      was isolated from the skin extract that lacked short-term cytotoxic and haemolytic 
      activity but significantly (p < 0.01) stimulated the rate of release of insulin from 
      BRIN-BD11 cells at concentrations ≥ 0.1 nM. The maximum response was 405% of the 
      basal rate at 5.6 mM ambient glucose concentration and 290% of basal rate at 16.7 mM 
      glucose. C-terminal α-amidation was necessary for high potency and a possible 
      mechanism of action of the peptide-involved membrane depolarization and an increase 
      in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration. Administration of tigerinin-1R (75 nmol/kg body 
      weight) to high fat-fed mice significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced insulin release and 
      improved glucose tolerance during the 60-min period following an intraperitoneal 
      glucose load. CONCLUSION: Tigerinin-1R is a potent, non-toxic insulin-releasing 
      peptide that shows potential for development into an agent for the treatment of type 
      2 diabetes.

TI  - Enhanced synonymous site divergence in positively selected vertebrate antimicrobial 
      peptide genes.
PG  - 445-55
AB  - Nonrandom patterns associated with adaptively evolving genes can shed light on how 
      selection and mutation produce rapid changes in sequences. I examine such patterns 
      in two independent families of antimicrobial peptide genes: those in frogs, which 
      are known to have evolved under positive selection, and those in flatfishes, which I 
      show have also evolved under positive selection. I address two recently proposed 
      hypotheses about the molecular evolution of antimicrobial peptide genes. The first 
      is that the mature peptide region is replicated by an error-prone polymerase that 
      increases the mutation rate and the transversion/transition ratio compared to the 
      signal sequence of the same genes. The second is that mature peptides evolve in a 
      coordinated fashion with their propieces, such that a change in net charge in one 
      molecular region prompts an opposite change in charge in the other region. I test 
      these hypotheses using alternative methods that minimize alignment errors, correct 
      for phylogenetic nonindependence, reduce sequence saturation, and account for 
      differing selection pressures on different regions of the gene. In both gene 
      families I show that divergence at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites within 
      the mature peptide region is enhanced. However, in neither gene family is there 
      evidence of an increased mutational transversion/transition ratio or coordinated 
      evolution. My observations are consistent with either an elevated mutation rate in 
      an adaptively evolving gene region or widespread selection on "silent" sites. These 
      hypotheses challenge the assumption that mutations are random and can be measured by 
      the synonymous substitution rate.

TI  - The Prepropalustrin-2CE2 and Preprobrevinin-2CE3　Gene from Rana　Chensinensis: Gene 
      Expression, Genomic Organization, and Functional Analysis of the Promoter Activity.
LID - 10.2174/0929866528666211125105627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palustrin-2CE2 and brevinin-2CE3 are antimicrobial peptides from Rana 
      chensinensis. In R. chensinensis tadpoles, the expression of prepropalustrin-2CE2 
      and preprobrevinin-2CE3 increased with the developmental stage. In addition, the 
      expression of the two genes was dramatically upregulated with stimulation by 
      Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and the chemical lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 
      The genomic organization of the two antimicrobial peptide genes was confirmed. Both 
      prepropalustrin-2CE2 and preprobrevinin-2CE3 contain three exons separated by two 
      large introns. Additionally, several presumed transcription factor binding sites 
      were identified in the promoter sequence. Functional analysis of the promoter was 
      performed using a luciferase reporter system, and further confirmed by yeast 
      one-hybrid experiment and EMSA assay. The results indicated that the transcription 
      factors NF-κB and RelA are involved in regulating the expression of 
      prepropalustrin-2CE2 and preprobrevinin-2CE3. As amphibian populations decline 
      globally, this study provides new data demonstrating how frogs defend against 
      pathogens from the environment by regulating AMP expression. For amphibians, 
      antimicrobial peptides are innate immune molecules that resist adverse external 
      environmental stimuli. However, the regulation mechanism of antimicrobial peptide 
      gene expression in frogs is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: The two antimicrobial 
      peptides, palustrin-2CE2 and brevinin-2CE3, are produced under external stimulation 
      in Rana chensinensis. Using this model, we analyzed the gene structure and 
      regulatory elements of the two antimicrobial peptide genes and explored the 
      regulatory effects of related transcription factors on the two genes. METHOD: 
      Different stimuli such as E. coli, S. aureus, and chemical substance 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were applied to Rana chensinensis tadpoles at different 
      developmental stages, and antimicrobial peptide expression levels were detected by 
      RT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis and 5'-RACE and genome walking technologies were 
      employed to analyze the genome structure and promoter region of the antimicrobial 
      peptide genes. With dual-luciferase reporter gene assays, yeast one-hybrid 
      experiment and EMSA assays, we assessed the regulatory effect of the endogenous 
      regulators of the cell on the antimicrobial peptide promoter. RESULTS: The 
      transcription levels of prepropalustrin-2CE2 and preprobrevinin-2CE3 were 
      significantly upregulated after different stimulations. Genomic structure analysis 
      showed that both genes contained three exons and two introns. Promoter analysis 
      indicated that there are binding sites for regulatory factors of the NF-κB family in 
      the promoter region, and experiments showed that endogenous NF-κB family regulatory 
      factors in frog cells activate the promoters of the antimicrobial peptide genes. 
      Yeast one-hybrid experiment and EMSA assay demonstrated that RelA and NF-κB1 might 
      interact with specific motifs in the prepropalustrin-2CE2 promoter. CONCLUSION: In 
      this paper, we found that the gene expression levels of the antimicrobial peptides, 
      palustrin-2CE2 and brevinin-2CE3, in R. chensinensis will increase under 
      environmental stimuli, and we verified that the changes in gene expression levels 
      are affected by the transcription factors RelA and NF-κB1. The yeast one-hybrid 
      experiment and EMSA assay confirmed that RelA and NF-κB1 could directly interact 
      with the frog antimicrobial peptide gene promoter, providing new data for the 
      regulatory mechanism of antimicrobial peptides in response to environmental stimuli.

AB  - Skin secretions from many species of anurans (frogs and toads) are a rich source of 
      peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities that may be developed into 
      agents with therapeutic potential, particularly for topical applications. This 
      chapter describes the use of norepinephrine (injection or immersion) to stimulate 
      peptide release from granular glands in the skin in procedures that do not appear to 
      cause distress to the animals. The peptide components in the secretions are 
      separated using reversed-phase HPLC on octadecylsilyl-silica (C(18)) columns after 
      partial purification on Sep-Pak C(18) cartridges. Peptides with antimicrobial 
      activity are then identified by demonstration of their abilities to inhibit growth 
      of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) 
      bacteria in liquid phase microtiter plate assays. Individual peptides with activity 
      are purified to near homogeneity by further chromatography on butylsilyl-(C(4)) and 
      diphenylmethylsilyl-silica columns and characterized structurally by automated Edman 
      degradation and mass spectrometry.

TI  - An amphibian antimicrobial peptide variant expressed in Nicotiana tabacum confers 
      resistance to phytopathogens.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - Esculentin-1 is a 46-residue antimicrobial peptide present in skin secretions of 
      Rana esculenta. It is effective against a wide variety of micro-organisms, including 
      plant pathogens with negligible effects on eukaryotic cells. As a possible approach 
      to enhance plant resistance, a DNA coding for esculentin-1, with the substitution 
      Met-28Leu, was fused at the C-terminal end of the leader sequence of 
      endopolygalacturonase-inhibiting protein, under the control of the cauliflower 
      mosaic virus 35S promoter region, and introduced into Nicotiana tabacum. The 
      antimicrobial peptide was isolated from the intercellular fluids of healthy leaves 
      of transgenic plants, suggesting that it was properly processed, secreted outside 
      cells and accumulated in the intercellular spaces. The morphology of transgenic 
      plants was unaffected. Challenging these plants with bacterial or fungal 
      phytopathogens demonstrated enhanced resistance up to the second generation. 
      Moreover, transgenic plants displayed insecticidal properties.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides with atypical structural features from the skin of the 
      Japanese brown frog Rana japonica.
PG  - 419-25
AB  - Japonicin-1 (FFPIGVFCKIFKTC) and japonicin-2 (FGLPMLSILPKALCILLKRKC), two peptides 
      with differential growth-inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacterium, 
      Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, were 
      isolated from an extract of the skin of the Japanese brown frog Rana japonica. Both 
      peptides show little amino acid sequence similarity to previously characterized 
      antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skins of Ranid frogs. Circular dichroism 
      studies, however, demonstrate that japonicin-2 adopts an alpha-helical conformation 
      in 50% trifluoroethanol in common with many other cationic antimicrobial peptides 
      synthesized in amphibian skin. Peptides belonging to the brevinin-1, brevinin-2, and 
      tigerinin families, previously identified in the skins of Asian Ranid frogs, were 
      not detected but a temporin-related peptide (ILPLVGNLLNDLL.NH(2); temporin-1Ja), 
      that atypically bears no net positive charge, was isolated from the extract. The 
      minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the peptides against E. coli were 
      japonicin-1, 30 microM; japonicin-2, 12 microM; and temporin-1Ja > 100 microM. The 
      MICs against S. aureus were japonicin-1, > 100 microM; japonicin-2, 20 microM; and 
      temporin-1Ja, > 100 microM.

TI  - The Influence of Habitat and Phylogeny on the Skin Microbiome of Amphibians in 
      Guatemala and Mexico.
PG  - 257-267
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1288-8 [doi]
AB  - Microbial symbionts are increasingly recognized as playing a critical role in 
      organismal health across a wide range of hosts. Amphibians are unique hosts in that 
      their skin helps to regulate the exchange of water, ions, and gases, and it plays an 
      active role in defense against pathogens through the synthesis of anti-microbial 
      peptides. The microbiome of amphibian skin includes a diverse community of bacteria 
      known to defend against pathogens, including the global pandemic lineage of 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis associated with mass amphibian die-offs. The relative 
      influence of host phylogeny and environment in determining the composition of the 
      amphibian skin microbiome remains poorly understood. We collected skin swabs from 
      montane amphibians in Mexico and Guatemala, focusing on two genera of plethodontid 
      salamanders and one genus of frogs. We used high throughput sequencing to 
      characterize the skin bacterial microbiome and tested the impact of phylogeny and 
      habitat on bacterial diversity. Our results show that phylogenetic history strongly 
      influences the diversity and community structure of the total bacterial microbiome 
      at higher taxonomic levels (between orders), but on lower scales (within genera and 
      species), the effect of habitat predominates. These results add to a growing 
      consensus that habitat exerts a strong effect on microbiome structure and 
      composition, particularly at shallow phylogenetic scales.

      are disulfide bridged. The peptide was named peptide leucine-arginine (pLR), 
      reflecting the N- and C-terminal residues. Molecular modeling predicted that pLR 
      possessed a rigid tertiary loop structure with flexible end regions. pLR was 
      synthesized and elicited rapid, noncytolytic histamine release that had a 2-fold 
      greater potency when compared with one of the most active histamine-liberating 
      peptides, namely melittin. pLR was able to permeabilize negatively charged 
      unilamellar lipid vesicles but not neutral vesicles, a finding that was consistent 
      with its nonhemolytic action. pLR inhibited the early development of granulocyte 
      macrophage colonies from bone marrow stem cells but did not induce apoptosis of the 
      end stage granulocytes, i.e. mature neutrophils. pLR therefore displays biological 
      activity with both granulopoietic progenitor cells and mast cells and thus 
      represents a novel bioactive peptide from frog skin.

TI  - Structure-function relationships of temporins, small antimicrobial peptides from 
      amphibian skin.
PG  - 1447-54
AB  - Temporins, antimicrobial peptides of 10-13 residues, were isolated from secretions 
      of Rana temporaria [Simmaco, M., Mignogna, G., Canofeni, S., Miele, R., Mangoni, 
      M.L. & Barra, D. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 242, 788-792]. These molecules are specific 
      to this amphibian species, which is also able to secrete on its skin other 
      antimicrobial peptides similar to those found in different Rana species. The effect 
      of temporins A, B and D (13 residues, net charge +2), and H (10 residues, net charge 
      +1 and +2, respectively) against both artificial membranes of differing lipid 
      composition and bacteria has been investigated in order to gain insight into their 
      mechanisms of action. The results indicate that: the lytic activity of temporins is 
      not greatly affected by the membrane composition; temporins A and B allow the 
      leakage of large-size molecules from the bacterial cells; temporin H renders both 
      the outer and inner membrane of bacteria permeable to hydrophobic substances of low 
      molecular mass; and temporin D, although devoid of antibacterial activity, has a 
      cytotoxic effect on erythrocytes. The results allow important conclusions to be 
      drawn about the minimal structural requirements for lytic efficiency and specificity 
      of temporins.

TI  - Skin peptides protect juvenile leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) against 
      chytridiomycosis.
PG  - 2908-16
LID - 10.1242/jeb.084145 [doi]
AB  - One issue of great concern for the scientific community is the continuing loss of 
      diverse amphibian species on a global scale. Amphibian populations around the world 
      are experiencing serious losses due to the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis. This pathogen colonizes the skin, leading to the disruption of ionic 
      balance and eventual cardiac arrest. In many species, antimicrobial peptides 
      secreted into the mucus are thought to contribute to protection against colonization 
      by skin pathogens. Although it is generally thought that antimicrobial peptides are 
      an important component of innate immune defenses against B. dendrobatidis, much of 
      the current evidence relies on correlations between effective antimicrobial peptide 
      defenses and species survival. There have been few studies to directly demonstrate 
      that antimicrobial peptides play a role. Using the northern leopard frog, Rana 
      pipiens, we show here that injection of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) brings about 
      a long-term depletion of skin peptides (initial concentrations do not recover until 
      after day 56). When peptide stores recovered, the renewed peptides were similar in 
      composition to the initial peptides as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 
      in activity against B. dendrobatidis as determined by growth inhibition assays. 
      Newly metamorphosed froglets depleted of their peptide stores and exposed to B. 
      dendrobatidis died more rapidly than B. dendrobatidis-exposed froglets with their 
      peptides intact. Thus, antimicrobial peptides in the skin mucus appear to provide 
      some resistance to B. dendrobatidis infections, and it is important for biologists 
      to recognize that this defense is especially important for newly metamorphosed frogs 
      in which the adaptive immune system is still immature.

TI  - Controls and constrains of the membrane disrupting action of Aurein 1.2.
PG  - 16378
LID - 10.1038/srep16378 [doi]
LID - 16378
AB  - Aurein 1.2 is a 13 residue antimicrobial peptide secreted by the Australian tree 
      frog Litoria Aurea. It is a surface-acting membrane disrupting peptide that 
      permeabilizes bacterial membranes via the carpet mechanism; the molecular details of 
      this process are mostly unknown. Here the mechanism of action of Aurein 1.2 was 
      investigated with an emphasis on the role of membrane charge and C-terminal 
      amidation of the peptide. Using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) fingerprinting it 
      was found that the membrane charge correlates with membrane affinity of the peptide, 
      however the binding and the membrane disrupting processes are not charge driven; 
      increased membrane charge reduces the membrane disrupting activity. Coarse grain 
      simulations revealed that phenylalanine residues act as membrane anchors. 
      Accordingly Aurein 1.2 has the ability to bind to any membrane. Furthermore, 
      bundling precludes membrane disruption in case of wild type peptides, while non 
      C-terminal amidated peptides form random aggregates leading to detachment from the 
      membrane. Hence C-terminal amidation is crucial for Aurein 1.2 action. Our results 
      suggest that Aurein 1.2 acts via aggregation driven membrane penetration. The 
      concomitant change in the tension of the outer leaflet imposes a spontaneous 
      curvature on the membrane, leading to disintegration.

TI  - Leptodactylus latrans Amphibian Skin Secretions as a Novel Source for the Isolation 
      of Antibacterial Peptides.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23112943 [doi]
LID - 2943
AB  - Amphibians´ skin produces a diverse array of antimicrobial peptides that play a 
      crucial role as the first line of defense against microbial invasion. Despite the 
      immense richness of wild amphibians in Argentina, current knowledge about the 
      presence of peptides with antimicrobial properties is limited to a only few species. 
      Here we used LC-MS-MS to identify antimicrobial peptides with masses ranging from 
      1000 to 4000 Da from samples of skin secretions of Leptodactylus latrans (Anura: 
      Leptodactylidae). Three novel amino acid sequences were selected for chemical 
      synthesis and further studies. The three synthetic peptides, named P1-Ll-1577, 
      P2-Ll-1298, and P3-Ll-2085, inhibited the growth of two ATCC strains, namely 
      Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. P3-Ll-2085 was the most active peptide. 
      In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and anionic liposomes, it adopted an 
      amphipathic α-helical structure. P2-Ll-1298 showed slightly lower activity than 
      P3-Ll-2085. Comparison of the MIC values of these two peptides revealed that the 
      addition of seven amino acid residues (GLLDFLK) on the N-terminal of P2-Ll-1298 
      significantly improved activity against both strains. P1-Ll-1577, which remarkably 
      is an anionic peptide, showed interesting antimicrobial activity against E. coli and 
      S. aureus strain, showing marked membrane selectivity and non-hemolysis. Due to 
      this, P1-L1-1577 emerges as a potential candidate for the development of new 
      antibacterial drugs.

TI  - Treatment of amphibians infected with chytrid fungus: learning from failed trials 
      with itraconazole, antimicrobial peptides, bacteria, and heat therapy.
PG  - 11-25
LID - 10.3354/dao02429 [doi]
AB  - Amphibian conservation goals depend on effective disease-treatment protocols. 
      Desirable protocols are species, life stage, and context specific, but currently few 
      treatment options exist for amphibians infected with the chytrid fungus 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Treatment options, at present, include 
      antifungal drugs and heat therapy, but risks of toxicity and side-effects make these 
      options untenable in some cases. Here, we report on the comparison of several novel 
      treatments with a more generally accepted antifungal treatment in experimental 
      scientific trials to treat Bd-infected frogs including Alytes obstetricans tadpoles 
      and metamorphs, Bufo bufo and Limnodynastes peronii metamorphs, and Lithobates 
      pipiens and Rana muscosa adults. The experimental treatments included commercial 
      antifungal products (itraconazole, mandipropamid, steriplantN, and PIP Pond Plus), 
      antimicrobial skin peptides from the Bd-resistant Pelophylax esculentus, microbial 
      treatments (Pedobacter cryoconitis), and heat therapy (35°C for 24 h). None of the 
      new experimental treatments were considered successful in terms of improving 
      survival; however, these results may advance future research by indicating the 
      limits and potential of the various protocols. Caution in the use of itraconazole is 
      warranted because of observed toxicity in metamorphic and adult frogs, even at low 
      concentrations. Results suggest that rather than focusing on a single cure-all, 
      diverse lines of research may provide multiple options for treating Bd infection in 
      amphibians. Learning from 'failed treatments' is essential for the timely 
      achievement of conservation goals and one of the primary aims for a publicly 
      accessible treatment database under development.

      secretions of Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis.
PG  - 411-7
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12256 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides as ancient immune system are found in almost all types of 
      living organisms. Amphibian's skin is an important source of bioactive peptides with 
      strong antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor properties. They have important role 
      in inducing apoptosis as well as cancer therapy in vitro. In this study, we 
      extracted and purified antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of Euphlyctis 
      cyanophlyctis and named them brevinin-Eu and cyanophlyctin β. They showed favorable 
      antibacterial properties on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with 
      ignorable hemolytic activity of <1.9% and 0.7% at very high concentrations of 
      brevinin-Eu and cyanophlyctin β, respectively. For antibacterial activity and MIC 
      determination, two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus PTCC1431 and B. cereus 
      PTCC1247) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli HP101BA 7601c and 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae PTCC1388) were assayed. MIC values of extracted peptides 
      demonstrated that they can inhibit bacterial growth at very low concentration (17 
      and 12 μg/mL) for brevinin-Eu and cyanophlyctin β, respectively. Structural 
      prediction suggested that the brevinin-Eu can efficiently bind and destroy bacterial 
      membrane, but cyanophlyctin β uses a diverse mode of action.

TI  - Identification of Novel Proteins in Foam Nests of the Japanese Forest Green Tree 
      Frog, Rhacophorus arboreus.
PG  - 8-19
LID - 10.2108/zs200113 [doi]
AB  - Foam nests of frogs are natural biosurfactants that contain potential compounds for 
      biocompatible materials, Drug Delivery System (DDS), emulsifiers, and 
      bioremediation. To elucidate the protein components in the foam nests of Rhacophorus 
      arboreus, which is an endemic Japanese frog species commonly seen during the rainy 
      season, we performed amino acid analysis, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and 
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using intact foam 
      nests. Many proteins were detected in these foam nests, ranging from a few to 
      several hundred kDa, with both essential and non-essential amino acids. Next, we 
      performed transcriptome analysis using a next-generation sequencer on total RNAs 
      extracted from oviducts before egg-laying. The soluble foam nests were purified by 
      LC-MS and analyzed using Edman degradation, and the identified N-terminal sequences 
      were matched to the transcriptome data. Four proteins that shared significant 
      sequence homologies with extracellular superoxide dismutase of Nanorana parkeri, 
      vitelline membrane outer layer protein 1 homolog of Xenopus tropicalis, ranasmurfin 
      of Polypedates leucomystax, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin of Sorex araneus were 
      identified. Prior to purification of the foam nests, they were treated with both a 
      reducing reagent and an alkylating agent, and LC-MS/ MS analyses were performed. We 
      identified 22 proteins in the foam nests that were homologous with proteinase 
      inhibitors, ribonuclease, glycoproteins, antimicrobial protein and barrier, 
      immunoglobulin-binding proteins, glycoprotein binding protein, colored protein, and 
      keratin-associated protein. The presence of these proteins in foam nests, along with 
      small molecules, such as carbohydrates and sugars, would protect them against 
      microbial and parasitic attack, oxidative stress, and a shortage of moisture.

TI  - Antiviral activity and mechanism of ESC-1GN from skin secretion of Hylarana 
      guentheri against influenza A virus.
PG  - 757-765
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvab019 [doi]
AB  - Development of new and effective antiinfluenza drugs is critical for prophylaxis and 
      treatment of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. A wide range of amphibian skin 
      secretions have been identified to show antiviral activity. Our previously reported 
      ESC-1GN, a peptide from the skin secretion of Hylarana guentheri, displayed good 
      antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. Here, we found that ESC-1GN possessed 
      significant antiviral effects against IAVs. Moreover, ESC-1GN could inhibit the 
      entry of divergent H5N1 and H1N1 virus strains with the IC50 values from 1.29 to 
      4.59 μM. Mechanism studies demonstrated that ESC-1GN disrupted membrane fusion 
      activity of IAVs by interaction with HA2 subunit. The results of site-directed 
      mutant assay and molecular docking revealed that E105, N50 and the residues around 
      them on HA2 subunit could form hydrogen bonds with amino acid on ESC-1GN, which were 
      critical for ESC-1GN binding to HA2 and inhibiting the entry of IAVs. Altogether, 
      these not only suggest that ESC-1GN maybe represent a new type of excellent template 
      designing drugs against IAVs, but also it may shed light on the immune mechanism and 
      survival strategy of H.guentheri against viral pathogens.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides and protease inhibitors in the skin secretions of the 
      crawfish frog, Rana areolata.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - The dorsal skin of the crawfish frog, Rana areolata, is associated with numerous 
      prominent granular glands. Proteomic analysis of electrically stimulated skin 
      secretions from these glands enabled the identification and characterization of 
      eight peptides with antimicrobial and hemolytic activity belonging to the previously 
      identified brevinin-1, temporin-1, palustrin-2, palustrin-3, esculentin-1 (two 
      peptides), and ranatuerin-2 (two peptides) families. The primary structures of the 
      peptides were consistent with a close phylogenetic relationship between R. areolata 
      and the pickerel frog, Rana palustris. Three structurally related cationic, 
      cysteine-containing peptides were identified that show sequence similarity to 
      peptide Leucine-Arginine, a peptide with immunomodulatory and histamine-releasing 
      properties from the skin of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens. The skin 
      secretions contained a 61-amino-acid-residue peptide that inhibited porcine trypsin 
      and possessed a 10-cysteine-residue motif that is characteristic of a protease 
      inhibitor previously isolated from the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. A 
      48-amino-acid-residue protein containing eight cysteine residues in the whey acidic 
      protein (WAP) motif, characteristic of elafin (skin-derived antileukoproteinase) and 
      secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, was also isolated. The data suggest that 
      protease inhibitors in skin secretions may play a role complementary to cationic, 
      amphipathic alpha-helical peptides in protecting anurans from invasions by 
      microorganisms.

AB  - Natural communities of microbes inhabiting amphibian skin, the skin microbiome, are 
      critical to supporting amphibian health and disease resistance. To enable the 
      pro-active health assessment and management of amphibians on Army installations and 
      beyond, we investigated the effects of acute (96h) munitions exposures to Rana 
      pipiens (leopard frog) tadpoles and the associated skin microbiome, integrated with 
      RNAseq-based transcriptomic responses in the tadpole host. Tadpoles were exposed to 
      the legacy munition 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), the new insensitive munition (IM) 
      formulation, IMX-101, and the IM constituents nitroguinidine (NQ) and 
      1-methyl-3-nitroguanidine (MeNQ). The 96h LC50 values and 95% confidence intervals 
      were 2.6 (2.4, 2.8) for ΣTNT and 68.2 (62.9, 73.9) for IMX-101, respectively. The NQ 
      and MeNQ exposures caused no significant impacts on survival in 96h exposures even 
      at maximum exposure levels of 3560 and 5285 mg/L, respectively. However, NQ and 
      MeNQ, as well as TNT and IMX-101 exposures, all elicited changes in the tadpole skin 
      microbiome profile, as evidenced by significantly increased relative proportions of 
      the Proteobacteria with increasing exposure concentrations, and significantly 
      decreased alpha-diversity in the NQ exposure. The potential for direct effects of 
      munitions exposure on the skin microbiome were observed including increased 
      abundance of munitions-tolerant phylogenetic groups, in addition to possible 
      indirect effects on microbial flora where transcriptional responses suggestive of 
      changes in skin mucus-layer properties, antimicrobial peptide production, and innate 
      immune factors were observed in the tadpole host. Additional insights into the 
      tadpole host's transcriptional response to munitions exposures indicated that TNT 
      and IMX-101 exposures significantly enriched transcriptional expression within 
      type-I and type-II xenobiotic metabolism pathways, where dose-responsive increases 
      in expression were observed. Significant enrichment and increased transcriptional 
      expression of heme and iron binding functions in the TNT exposures served as likely 
      indicators of known mechanisms of TNT toxicity including hemolytic anemia and 
      methemoglobinemia. The significant enrichment and dose-responsive decrease in 
      transcriptional expression of cell cycle pathways in the IMX-101 exposures was 
      consistent with previous observations in fish, while significant enrichment of 
      immune-related function in response to NQ exposure were consistent with potential 
      immune suppression at the highest NQ exposure concentration. Finally, the MeNQ 
      exposures elicited significantly decreased transcriptional expression of keratin 16, 
      type I, a gene likely involved in keratinization processes in amphibian skin. 
      Overall, munitions showed the potential to alter tadpole skin microbiome composition 
      and affect transcriptional profiles in the amphibian host, some suggestive of 
      potential impacts on host health and immune status relevant to disease 
      susceptibility.

TI  - Population trends associated with skin peptide defenses against chytridiomycosis in 
      Australian frogs.
PG  - 531-40
AB  - Many species of amphibians in the wet tropics of Australia have experienced 
      population declines linked with the emergence of a skin-invasive chytrid fungus, 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. An innate defense, antimicrobial peptides produced 
      by granular glands in the skin, may protect some species from disease. Here we 
      present evidence that supports this hypothesis. We tested ten synthesized peptides 
      produced by Australian species, and natural peptide mixtures from five Queensland 
      rainforest species. Natural mixtures and most peptides tested in isolation inhibited 
      growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro. The three most active peptides (caerin 1.9, 
      maculatin 1.1, and caerin 1.1) were found in the secretions of non-declining species 
      (Litoria chloris, L. caerulea, and L. genimaculata). Although the possession of a 
      potent isolated antimicrobial peptide does not guarantee protection from infection, 
      non-declining species (L. lesueuri and L. genimaculata) inhabiting the rainforest of 
      Queensland possess mixtures of peptides that may be more protective than those of 
      the species occurring in the same habitat that have recently experienced population 
      declines associated with chytridiomycosis (L. nannotis, L. rheocola, and Nyctimystes 
      dayi). This study demonstrates that in vitro effectiveness of skin peptides 
      correlates with the degree of decline in the face of an emerging pathogen. Further 
      research is needed to assess whether this non-specific immune defense may be useful 
      in predicting disease susceptibility in other species.

AB  - Amphibian antimicrobial peptides have been known for many decades and several of 
      them have already been isolated. However, the number of species investigated is 
      still small. Herein, we report on the skin secretions of Leptodactylus ocellatus, 
      which were extracted by mild electrical stimulation and its semi-preparative 
      reverse-phase chromatography was resolved in more than 30 fractions. Among these 
      fractions, two novel antimicrobial peptides were isolated and their amino acid 
      sequences determined by de novo sequencing. The ocellatins-5 and -6 (21 and 22 amino 
      acid residues, respectively) are amidated at the C-terminus. Ocellatins inhibited 
      the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) 
      and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) with minimal inhibition 
      concentration values in the range of 32-128 microg/mL. The amino acid sequence of 
      the peptides shows structural similarity with members of the antimicrobial peptides 
      found in the skin secretion of other leptodactylid frogs. This observation is 
      consistent with the hypothesis that many frog skin antimicrobial peptides are 
      related evolutionarily, having arisen from multiple duplications of an ancestral 
      gene that existed before the radiation of the different species.

TI  - Multiple antimicrobial peptides and peptides related to bradykinin and neuromedin N 
      isolated from skin secretions of the pickerel frog, Rana palustris.
PG  - 95-105
AB  - The skin secretions of the North American pickerel frog Rana palustris are toxic to 
      both microorganisms and predators. A total of 22 peptides with differential 
      growth-inhibitory activity towards bacteria and yeast were isolated from the 
      electrostimulated secretions of R. palustris skin and were characterized 
      structurally. Thirteen of the antimicrobial peptides belong to five of the known 
      families previously identified in the skins of other species of Ranid frogs: 
      brevinin-1 (3 peptides), esculentin-1 (2 peptides), esculentin-2 (1 peptide), 
      ranatuerin-2 (6 peptides), and temporin (1 peptide). Nine peptides show little 
      structural similarity towards other known antimicrobial peptides and so are 
      classified in new families: palustrin-1 (4 peptides) with 27-28 amino acid residues 
      and a cystine-bridged heptapeptide ring; palustrin-2 (3 peptides) with 31 amino 
      acids and a cyclic heptapeptide region and palustrin-3 (2 peptides) with 48 amino 
      acids and a cyclic hexapeptide region. Peptides belonging to the esculentin-1, 
      esculentin-2 and palustrin-3 families are the most potent (minimal inhibitory 
      concentrations approximately 1 microM against Escherichia coli) whereas peptides of 
      the brevinin-1 and esculentin-2 families show the broadest spectrum of activity. As 
      well as bradykinin that is identical to the human peptide, a further 4 peptides 
      structurally related to [Leu(8)]bradykinin and two peptides related to neuromedin-N 
      (the hexapeptide KKPYIL and a larger, cystine-containing form HLRRCGKKPYILMACS) were 
      purified from the skin secretions.

TI  - An EThcD-Based Method for Discrimination of Leucine and Isoleucine Residues in 
      Tryptic Peptides.
PG  - 1600-1611
LID - 10.1007/s13361-017-1674-3 [doi]
AB  - An EThcD-based approach for the reliable discrimination of isomeric leucine and 
      isoleucine residues in peptide de novo sequencing procedure has been proposed. A 
      multistage fragmentation of peptide ions was performed with Orbitrap Elite mass 
      spectrometer in electrospray ionization mode. At the first stage, z-ions were 
      produced by ETD or ETcaD fragmentation of doubly or triply charged peptide precursor 
      ions. These primary ions were further fragmented by HCD with broad-band ion 
      isolation, and the resulting w-ions showed different mass for leucine and isoleucine 
      residues. The procedure did not require manual isolation of specific z-ions prior to 
      HCD stage. Forty-three tryptic peptides (3 to 27 residues) obtained by trypsinolysis 
      of human serum albumin (HSA) and gp188 protein were analyzed. To demonstrate a 
      proper solution for radical site migration problem, three non-tryptic peptides were 
      also analyzed. A total of 93 leucine and isoleucine residues were considered and 83 
      of them were correctly identified. The developed approach can be a reasonable 
      substitution for additional Edman degradation procedure, which is still used in 
      peptide sequencing for leucine and isoleucine discrimination. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.

TI  - Comparison of Anti-Viral Activity of Frog Skin Anti-Microbial Peptides Temporin-Sha 
      and [K³]SHa to LL-37 and Temporin-Tb against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1.

AB  - Temporins are anti-microbial peptides synthesized in the skin of frogs of the 
      Ranidae family. The few studies to date that have examined their anti-viral 
      properties have shown that they have potential as anti-viral therapies. In this 
      work, we evaluated the anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) activity of the 
      temporin-SHa (SHa) and its synthetic analog [K³]SHa. Human cathelicidin LL-37 and 
      temporin-Tb (Tb), previously demonstrated to have anti-HSV-1 properties, were used 
      as positive controls. We observed that SHa and [K³]SHa significantly inhibit HSV-1 
      replication in human primary keratinocytes when used at micromolar concentrations. 
      This anti-viral activity was equivalent to that of Tb, but lower than that of LL-37. 
      Transcriptomic analyses revealed that SHa did not act through the modulation of the 
      cell innate immune response, but rather, displayed virucidal properties by reducing 
      infectious titer of HSV-1 in suspension. In contrast, pre-incubation of the virus 
      with LL-37 suggests that this peptide does not act directly on the viral particle at 
      non-cytotoxic concentrations tested. The anti-HSV-1 activity of LL-37 appears to be 
      due to the potentiation of cellular anti-viral defenses through the induction of 
      interferon stimulated gene expression in infected primary keratinocytes. This study 
      demonstrated that SHa and [K³]SHa, in addition to their previously reported 
      antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, are direct-acting anti-HSV-1 peptides. 
      Importantly, this study extends the little studied anti-viral attributes of frog 
      temporins and offers perspectives for the development of new anti-HSV-1 therapies.

AB  - Frogs such as Rana temporaria and Litoria aurea secrete numerous closely related 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as an effective chemical dermal defence. Damage or 
      penetration of the bacterial plasma membrane is considered essential for AMP 
      activity and such properties are commonly ascribed to their ability to form 
      secondary amphipathic, α-helix conformations in membrane mimicking milieu. 
      Nevertheless, despite the high similarity in physical properties and preference for 
      adopting such conformations, the spectrum of activity and potency of AMPs often 
      varies considerably. Hence distinguishing apparently similar AMPs according to their 
      behaviour in, and effects on, model membranes will inform understanding of 
      primary-sequence-specific antimicrobial mechanisms. Here we use a combination of 
      molecular dynamics simulations, circular dichroism and patch-clamp to investigate 
      the basis for differing anti-bacterial activities in representative AMPs from each 
      species; temporin L and aurein 2.5. Despite adopting near identical, α-helix 
      conformations in the steady-state in a variety of membrane models, these two AMPs 
      can be distinguished both in vitro and in silico based on their dynamic interactions 
      with model membranes, notably their differing conformational flexibility at the 
      N-terminus, ability to form higher order aggregates and the characteristics of 
      induced ion conductance. Taken together, these differences provide an explanation of 
      the greater potency and broader antibacterial spectrum of activity of temporin L 
      over aurein 2.5. Consequently, while the secondary amphipathic, α-helix conformation 
      is a key determinant of the ability of a cationic AMP to penetrate and disrupt the 
      bacterial plasma membrane, the exact mechanism, potency and spectrum of activity is 
      determined by precise structural and dynamic contributions from specific residues in 
      each AMP sequence.

TI  - Predicting the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for Antimicrobial Peptides with

PG  - 2275-87
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00161 [doi]
AB  - The global spreading of multidrug resistance has motivated the search for new 
      antibiotic classes including different types of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). 
      Computational methods for predicting activity in terms of the minimal inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) of AMPs can facilitate "in silico" design and reduce the cost of 
      synthesis and testing. We have used an original method for separating training and 
      test data sets, both of which contain the sequences and measured MIC values of 
      non-homologous anuran peptides having the Rana-box disulfide motif at their 
      C-terminus. Using a more flexible profiling methodology (sideways asymmetry moment, 
      SAM) than the standard hydrophobic moment, we have developed a two-descriptor model 
      to predict the bacteriostatic activity of Rana-box peptides against Gram-negative 
      bacteria--the first multilinear quantitative structure-activity relationship model 
      capable of predicting MIC values for AMPs of widely different lengths and low 
      identity using such a small number of descriptors. Maximal values for SAMs, as 
      defined and calculated in our method, furthermore offer new structural insight into 
      how different segments of a peptide contribute to its bacteriostatic activity, and 
      this work lays the foundations for the design of active artificial AMPs with this 
      type of disulfide bridge.

AB  - PGLa-AM1 (GMASKAGSVL(10)GKVAKVALKA(20)AL.NH(2)) was first identified in skin 
      secretions of the frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae) on the basis of its antimicrobial 
      properties. PGLa-AM1 and its [A14K] and [A20K] analogues produced a 
      concentration-dependent stimulation of insulin release from BRIN-BD11 rat clonal 
      β-cells without cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 3 μM. In contrast, the [A3K] 
      analogue was cytotoxic at concentrations ≥ 30 nM. The potency and maximum rate of 
      insulin release produced by the [A14K] and [A20K] peptides were significantly 
      greater than produced by PGLa-AM1. [A14K]PGLa-AM1 also stimulated insulin release 
      from mouse islets at concentrations ≥ 1 nM and from the 1.1B4 human-derived 
      pancreatic β-cell line at concentrations > 30 pM. PGLa-AM1 (1 μM) produced membrane 
      depolarization in BRIN-BD11 cells with a small, but significant (P < 0.05), increase 
      in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations but the peptide had no direct effect on 
      K(ATP) channels. The [A14K] analogue (1 μM) produced a significant increase in cAMP 
      concentration in BRIN-BD11 cells and down-regulation of the protein kinase A pathway 
      by overnight incubation with forskolin completely abolished the insulin-releasing 
      effects of the peptide. [A14K]PGLa-AM1 (1 μM) protected against cytokine-induced 
      apoptosis (p < 0.001) in BRIN-BD11 cells and augmented (p < 0.001) proliferation of 
      the cells to a similar extent as GLP-1. Intraperitoneal administration of the [A14K] 
      and [A20K] analogues (75 nmol/kg body weight) to both lean mice and high fat-fed 
      mice with insulin resistance improved glucose tolerance with a concomitant increase 
      in insulin secretion. The data provide further support for the assertion that host 
      defense peptides from frogs belonging to the Pipidae family show potential for 
      development into agents for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The evolution of predatory, anti-predatory, and defensive strategies regarding 
      environmental adaptation in animals is of significant research interest. In 
      particular, amphibians, who represent a transition between aquatic and terrestrial 
      vertebrates, play an important role in animal evolution. The bioactive skin 
      secretions of amphibians are of specific interest due to their involvement in the 
      crucial physiological functions of amphibian skin. We previously isolated and 
      identified several bioactive peptides, including those showing antioxidant, 
      antimicrobial, and wound-healing properties, from the skin secretions of the odorous 
      frog species Odorrana andersonii. Currently, however, the biological significance of 
      skin secretions in O. andersonii survival remains unclear. Here, we studied the 
      biological significance of skin glands and secretions in regard to environmental 
      adaptations of O. andersonii. Our research found that O. andersonii may secrete and 
      excrete bioactive secretions through many glands (peptides and proteins as the main 
      components in glands) distributed in the skin. The skin secretions not only 
      displayed toxicity but also showed antioxidant, antibacterial, and repair promoting 
      activities, suggesting that they play a protective role in O. andersonii when facing 
      environmental threats. These bioactive skin secretions appear to act as a chemical 
      survival strategy in O. andersonii, allowing the species to gain advantages in 
      survival behavior.

TI  - Antioxidant peptidomics reveals novel skin antioxidant system.
PG  - 571-83
LID - 10.1074/mcp.M800297-MCP200 [doi]
AB  - It is generally agreed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to skin aging, 
      skin disorders, and skin diseases. Skin possesses an extremely efficient antioxidant 
      system. This antioxidant activity is conferred by two systems: antioxidant enzymes 
      and small molecules that can scavenge ROS by donating electrons. No gene-encoded 
      secreted ROS scavengers have been reported. Amphibian skin is a multifunctional 
      organ acting in defense, respiration, and water regulation, although it seems 
      susceptible. Amphibian skins are easily harmed by biological or non-biological 
      attacks such as microorganism infection or radiation injury. Among vertebrates, 
      skins of amphibian are exposed to more dangers of radiation injury than others. 
      Radiation toxicity occurs by directly attacking the genetic material and/or by 
      generating ROS. In addition, amphibian skin respiration and inflammatory response 
      also induce ROS generation. It is rational to hypothesize that amphibian skins 
      should have potent free radical scavenging and radioprotective ability for their 
      survival. Rana pleuraden is distributed in Southwest of China; it lives in the 
      subtropical plateau (altitude around 2300 m) where there is strong ultraviolet 
      radiation and long duration of sunshine. By peptidomics and genomics approaches, a 
      large amount of antioxidant peptides belonging to 11 different groups with variable 
      structures were isolated from the skin secretions of R. pleuraden. Their free 
      radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory abilities were studied. All of these 
      peptide share highly homologous preproregions, although mature antioxidant peptides 
      have very divergent primary structures, suggesting the possibility of a common 
      ancestor. Some peptides were also found to have multifunctional properties, such as 
      combined antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. According to 
      our knowledge, no gene-encoded specific antioxidant peptides have been reported 
      except metallothionein. Our work possibly reveals a new skin antioxidant system. The 
      current work also provides a large amount of peptide candidates with 
      medical-pharmaceutical significance.

TI  - Bi-functional peptides with both trypsin-inhibitory and antimicrobial activities are 
      frequent defensive molecules in Ranidae amphibian skins.
PG  - 309-16

AB  - Amphibian skins act as the first line against noxious aggression by microorganisms, 
      parasites, and predators. Anti-microorganism activity is an important task of 
      amphibian skins. A large amount of gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has 
      been identified from amphibian skins. Only a few of small protease inhibitors have 
      been found in amphibian skins. From skin secretions of 5 species (Odorrana livida, 
      Hylarana nigrovittata, Limnonectes kuhlii, Odorrana grahami, and Amolops loloensis) 
      of Ranidae frogs, 16 small serine protease inhibitor peptides have been purified and 
      characterized. They have lengths of 17-20 amino acid residues (aa). All of them are 
      encoded by precursors with length of 65-70 aa. These small peptides show strong 
      trypsin-inhibitory abilities. Some of them can exert antimicrobial activities. They 
      share the conserved GCWTKSXXPKPC fragment in their primary structures, suggesting 
      they belong to the same families of peptide. Signal peptides of precursors encoding 
      these serine protease inhibitors share obvious sequence similarity with those of 
      precursors encoding AMPs from Ranidae frogs. The current results suggest that these 
      small serine protease inhibitors are the common defensive compounds in frog skin of 
      Ranidae as amphibian skin AMPs.

TI  - Stability of microbiota facilitated by host immune regulation: informing probiotic 
      strategies to manage amphibian disease.
PG  - e87101

AB  - Microbial communities can augment host immune responses and probiotic therapies are 
      under development to prevent or treat diseases of humans, crops, livestock, and 
      wildlife including an emerging fungal disease of amphibians, chytridiomycosis. 
      However, little is known about the stability of host-associated microbiota, or how 
      the microbiota is structured by innate immune factors including antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) abundant in the skin secretions of many amphibians. Thus, 
      conservation medicine including therapies targeting the skin will benefit from 
      investigations of amphibian microbial ecology that provide a model for vertebrate 
      host-symbiont interactions on mucosal surfaces. Here, we tested whether the 
      cutaneous microbiota of Panamanian rocket frogs, Colostethus panamansis, was 
      resistant to colonization or altered by treatment. Under semi-natural outdoor 
      mesocosm conditions in Panama, we exposed frogs to one of three treatments 
      including: (1) probiotic - the potentially beneficial bacterium Lysinibacillus 
      fusiformis, (2) transplant - skin washes from the chytridiomycosis-resistant glass 
      frog Espadarana prosoblepon, and (3) control - sterile water. Microbial assemblages 
      were analyzed by a culture-independent T-RFLP analysis. We found that skin 
      microbiota of C. panamansis was resistant to colonization and did not differ among 
      treatments, but shifted through time in the mesocosms. We describe regulation of 
      host AMPs that may function to maintain microbial community stability. Colonization 
      resistance was metabolically costly and microbe-treated frogs lost 7-12% of body 
      mass. The discovery of strong colonization resistance of skin microbiota suggests a 
      well-regulated, rather than dynamic, host-symbiont relationship, and suggests that 
      probiotic therapies aiming to enhance host immunity may require an approach that 
      circumvents host mechanisms maintaining equilibrium in microbial communities.

TI  - Novel lynx spider toxin shares common molecular architecture with defense peptides 
      from frog skin.
PG  - 4382-93

AB  - A unique 30-residue cationic peptide oxyopinin 4a (Oxt 4a) was identified in the 
      venom of the lynx spider Oxyopes takobius (Oxyopidae). Oxt 4a contains a single 
      N-terminally located disulfide bond, Cys4-Cys10, and is structurally different from 
      any spider toxin studied so far. According to NMR findings, the peptide is 
      disordered in water, but assumes a peculiar torpedo-like structure in detergent 
      micelles. It features a C-terminal amphipathic α-helical segment (body; residues 
      12-25) and an N-terminal disulfide-stabilized loop (head; residues 1-11), and has an 
      unusually high density of positive charge in the head region. Synthetic Oxt 4a was 
      produced and shown to possess strong and broad-spectrum cytolytic and antimicrobial 
      activity. cDNA cloning showed that the peptide is synthesized in the form of a 
      conventional prepropeptide with an acidic prosequence. Unlike other arachnid toxins, 
      Oxt 4a exhibits striking similarity with defense peptides from the skin of ranid 
      frogs that contain the so-called Rana-box motif (a C-terminal disulfide-enclosed 
      loop). Parallelism or convergence is apparent on several levels: the structure, 
      function and biosynthesis of a lynx spider toxin are mirrored by those of Rana-box 
      peptides from frogs.

AB  - While investigating the innate defense of brackish water-living amphibian and its 
      comparison with freshwater-living amphibians, two novel 12-residue antimicrobial 
      peptides were purified from the skin secretions of the crab-eating frog, Fejervarya 
      cancrivora which typically inhabits brackish water of mangrove forests of Southeast 
      Asia. These two antimicrobial peptides, tigerinin-RC1 and -RC2 share significant 
      structural similarity with tigerinins found in the skin of Indian frog, 
      Hoplobatrachus tigerinus. cDNAs encoding tigerinin-RC1 and -RC2 were also cloned 
      from the skin cDNA library of F. cancrivora. Tigerinin-RC precursors are composed of 
      71 amino acid residues including a signal peptide, acidic spacer peptide, which are 
      very similar to other amphibian antimicrobial peptide precursors and mature 
      tigerinin-RC. The current results confirmed that both amphibians inhabiting 
      freshwater and brackish water share the same antimicrobial peptide family to exert 
      innate defense. Furthermore, the current work was also the first report of precursor 
      and cDNA cloning of the tigerinin antimicrobial peptide family.

TI  - Genome duplications within the Xenopodinae do not increase the multiplicity of 
      antimicrobial peptides in Silurana paratropicalis and Xenopus andrei skin 
      secretions.
PG  - 206-12
LID - 10.1016/j.cbd.2011.03.003 [doi]
AB  - A putative genome duplication event within the Silurana lineage has given rise to 
      the tetraploid frog S. paratropicalis and a second polyploidization within the 
      Xenopus lineage has produced the octoploid frog X. andrei. Peptidomic analysis of 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of S. paratropicalis and X. andrei led to 
      identification of multiple peptides with growth-inhibitory activity against 
      Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Structural characterization demonstrated 
      that the S. paratropicalis components comprised three peptides belonging to the 
      caerulein-precursor fragment family (CPF-SP1, -SP2 and -SP3), two peptides from the 
      xenopsin-precursor fragment family (XPF-SP1 and -SP2), and one peptide orthologous 
      to peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-SP1). The CPF peptides showed potent, 
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The X. andrei components comprised two 
      peptides from the magainin family, (magainin-AN1 and -AN2), two from the XPF family 
      (XPF-AN1 and -AN2), two from the PGLa family(PGLa-AN1 and -AN2), and one 
      caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AN1).The primary structures of these peptides 
      indicate a close phylogenetic relationship between X. andrei and the octoploid frog 
      X. amieti. Under the same experimental conditions, seven orthologous antimicrobial 
      peptides were previously isolated from the diploid frog S. tropicalis, nine from the 
      tetraploid frog X. borealis, and five from the tetraploid frog X. clivii. The data 
      indicate, therefore, that nonfunctionalization (gene deletion) has been the most 
      common fate of duplicated antimicrobial peptide genes following polyploidization 
      events in the Silurana and Xenopus lineages.

TI  - Assessing Antibacterial Potential of Components of Phyllomedusa distincta Skin and 
      its Associated Dermal Microbiota.

AB  - The granular glands of anuran skin secrete an array of bioactive molecules that 
      protect a frog against pathogens and predators. The skin also harbors a microbial 
      community. Although there is evidence to suggest that the microbiota complement the 
      innate immune defense systems against pathogen infection, the effect of the frog 
      bioactive molecules on its resident microbiota has not yet been fully investigated. 
      In the present study, the skin microbiota of Phyllomedusa distincta obtained from 
      two different geographical areas was evaluated with molecular and culture-based 
      approaches. The antagonistic effects exhibited by the host's microbiota and by a 
      novel dermaseptin peptide isolated from P. distincta skin were investigated. Four 
      isolated bacterial colonies displayed antimicrobial activity against known frog 
      pathogens. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that microbiota from P. 
      distincta may interact with pathogenic microorganisms to protect a frog's health. On 
      the other hand, the novel dermaseptin peptide exhibited an antimicrobial effect on 
      pathogens as well as on some of the bacteria obtained from the skin microbiota. The 
      richness of bacteria on P. distincta skin was further investigated by 16S rRNA gene 
      clone libraries, which revealed that the family Enterobacteriaceae was prevalent, 
      but a high variability at the species level was observed among individual frogs. 
      Differences observed on the microbiota of frogs from contrasting habitats indicated 
      an influence of the environment on the structure of the skin microbiota of P. 
      distincta.

AB  - Traditional sources of mRNA for molecular cloning on amphibian skin secretion 
      studies have been the frog's skin and skin secretions. Here, we demonstrate that 
      mRNA isolated from chromatographic fractions of skin secretions is amenable for 
      molecular cloning assays. We identified precursor sequences of the Arg(0), Trp(5), 
      Leu(8)-bradykinin and six antimicrobial peptides of Pelophylax esculentus (Ranidae). 
      These results show that both transcriptomic and peptidomic analyses can be performed 
      with a single sample reducing in half the amount of starting skin secretion 
      required. This is a significant advantage when working with endangered or very rare 
      amphibian species, where minimal samples are available.

TI  - Host-defense peptides from skin secretions of the tetraploid frogs Xenopus petersii 
      and Xenopus pygmaeus, and the octoploid frog Xenopus lenduensis (Pipidae).
PG  - 35-43
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.11.015 [doi]
AB  - Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions led to the 
      identification of host-defense peptides belonging to the magainin, peptide 
      glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa), and caerulein precursor fragment (CPF) families from 
      the tetraploid frogs, Xenopus petersii (Peters' clawed frog) and Xenopus pygmaeus 
      (Bouchia clawed frog), and the octoploid frog Xenopus lenduensis (Lendu Plateau 
      clawed frog). Xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) peptides were not detected. The 
      primary structures of the antimicrobial peptides from X. petersii demonstrate a 
      close, but not conspecific relationship, with Xenopus laevis whereas the X. pygmaeus 
      peptides show appreciable variation from previously characterized orthologs from 
      other Xenopus species. Polyploidization events within the Xenopodinae 
      (Silurana+Xenopus) are associated with extensive gene silencing (nonfunctionization) 
      but unexpectedly the full complement of four PGLa paralogs were isolated from X. 
      lenduendis secretions. Consistent with previous data, the CPF peptides showed the 
      highest growth-inhibitory activity against bacteria with CPF-PG1 
      (GFGSLLGKALKIGTNLL.NH(2)) from X. pygmaeus combining high antimicrobial potency 
      against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=6 μM) with relatively low hemolytic activity 
      (LC(50)=145 μM).

TI  - The hymenochirins: a family of host-defense peptides from the Congo dwarf clawed 
      frog Hymenochirus boettgeri (Pipidae).
PG  - 269-75
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2012.03.029 [doi]
AB  - Skin secretions of frogs from the subfamily Xenopodinae (Xenopus+Silurana) within 
      the family Pipidae are a rich source of antimicrobial peptides with therapeutic 
      potential but species from the sister taxon Hymenochirus in the subfamily Pipinae 
      (Hymenochirus+Pseudhymenochirus+Pipa) have not been investigated. Peptidomic 
      analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from two distinct populations 
      of the Congo dwarf clawed frog Hymenochirus boettgeri (Tornier, 1896) has led to 
      identification of five structurally related peptides with broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activity. Hymenochirin-1B (IKLSPETKDNLKKVLKGAIKGAIAVAKMV.NH(2)) is 
      C-terminally α-amidated whereas hymenochirins-2B-5B have the general structure 
      XKIPX(2)VKDTLKKVAKGX(2)SX(2)AGAX(3).COOH. Hymenochirin-3B 
      (IKIPAVVKDTLKKVAKGVLSAVAGALTQ) was the most abundant peptide in the secretions. The 
      hymenochirins show very low structural similarity with the antimicrobial peptides 
      isolated from skin secretions of Silurana tropicalis and Xenopus laevis consistent 
      with the proposed ancient divergence of the Pipinae and Xenopodinae. Synthetic 
      replicates of hymenochirin-1B-4B inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC in the range 10-40 
      μM) and Candida albicans (MIC=80 μM). The peptides display relatively weak hemolytic 
      activity against human erythrocytes (LC(50) in the range 160 to >300 μM).

AB  - Cathelicidins play pivotal roles in host defense. The discovery of novel 
      cathelicidins is important research; however, despite the identification of many 
      cathelicidins in vertebrates, few have been reported in amphibians. Here we 
      identified a novel cathelicidin (named cathelicidin-OA1) from the skin of an 
      amphibian species, Odorrana andersonii. Produced by posttranslational processing of 
      a 198-residue prepropeptide, cathelicidin-OA1 presented an amino acid sequence of 
      'IGRDPTWSHLAASCLKCIFDDLPKTHN' and a molecular mass of 3038.5 Da. Functional analysis 
      showed that, unlike other cathelicidins, cathelicidin-OA1 demonstrated no direct 
      microbe-killing, acute toxicity and hemolytic activity, but did exhibit antioxidant 
      activity. Importantly, cathelicidin-OA1 accelerated wound healing against human 
      keratinocytes (HaCaT) and skin fibroblasts (HSF) in both time- and dose-dependent 
      manners. Notably, cathelicidin-OA1 also showed wound-healing promotion in a mouse 
      model with full-thickness skin wounds, accelerating re-epithelialization and 
      granulation tissue formation by enhancing the recruitment of macrophages to the 
      wound site, inducing HaCaT cell proliferation and HSF cell migration. This is the 
      first cathelicidin identified from an amphibian that shows potent wound-healing 
      activity. These results will help in the development of new types of wound-healing 
      agents and in our understanding of the biological functions of cathelicidins.

AB  - We developed genetic resources for two North American frogs, Lithobates clamitans 
      and Pseudacris regilla, widespread native amphibians that are potential indicator 
      species of environmental health. For both species, mRNA from multiple tissues was 
      sequenced using 454 technology. De novo assemblies with Mira3 resulted in 50 238 
      contigs (N50 = 687 bp) and 48 213 contigs (N50 = 686 bp) for L. clamitans and 
      P. regilla, respectively, after clustering with CD-Hit-EST and purging contigs below 
      200 bp. We performed BLASTX similarity searches against the Xenopus tropicalis 
      proteome and, for predicted ORFs, HMMER similarity searches against the Pfam-A 
      database. Because there is broad interest in amphibian immune factors, we manually 
      annotated putative antimicrobial peptides. To identify conserved regions suitable 
      for amplicon resequencing across a broad taxonomic range, we performed an additional 
      assembly of public short-read transcriptome data derived from two species of the 
      genus Rana and identified reciprocal best TBLASTX matches among all assemblies. 
      Although P. regilla, a hylid frog, is substantially more diverged from the ranid 
      species, we identified 56 genes that were sufficiently conserved to allow 
      nondegenerate primer design with Primer3. In addition to providing a foundation for 
      comparative genomics and quantitative gene expression analysis, our results enable 
      quick development of nuclear sequence-based markers for phylogenetics or population 
      genetics.

TI  - Identification and polymorphism discovery of the cathelicidins, Lf-CATHs in ranid

AB  - To protect themselves against the invasion of microorganisms, amphibians, especially 
      the Rana frogs, are possibly equipped with complex combinations of antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs). The two major AMP families, ranid skin secretion AMPs and 
      cathelicidins might together constitute the host innate immune system of amphibians. 
      Cathelicidins are a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial 
      cells, and they play a central role in the early innate immune defense found in 
      virtually all species of mammals. However, they have rarely been reported from 
      amphibians. Here, we report the identification and discovery of polymorphism 
      cathelicidins in Limnonectes fragilis. The expression profile indicated high 
      cathelicidin transcript levels in frog spleen, liver and kidney, but lower levels in 
      lung, skin and stomach. According to the amphibian's unique proteolytic pattern, 
      R125 and L121 of the prepropeptides are predicted to be the processing positions for 
      protease to generate the mature peptides, Lf-CATH1 and -2, respectively. Both 
      consist of 30 amino acid residues, of which two were cysteines positionally 
      conserved among a few known amphibian cathelicidins. Homology modeling analysis 
      revealed that Lf-CATH1 and -2 adopt a tertiary structure with a mostly α helix that 
      is representative of small cationic cathelicidin family peptides. Recombinant 
      Lf-CATH1 (rLf-CATH1) was produced in Escherichia coli. Synthetic Lf-CATH1 and -2 
      displayed potent antimicrobial activities in vitro against a broad spectrum of 
      microorganisms, including standard and clinically isolated drug-resistant strains, 
      while showing neglectable hemolysis and cytotoxicities.

TI  - Amphibian cathelicidin fills the evolutionary gap of cathelicidin in vertebrate.
PG  - 677-85
LID - 10.1007/s00726-011-1116-7 [doi]
AB  - Cathelicidins comprise a family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) sharing a highly 
      conserved cathelin domain, and play a central role in the innate defense against 
      infection in most of vertebrates. But so far it has not yet been found in amphibians 
      although a large number of other groups of AMPs have been identified. In the current 
      work, the first amphibian cathelicidin (cathelicidin-AL) has been characterized from 
      the frog skin of Amolops loloensis. Cathelicidin-AL 
      (RRSRRGRGGGRRGGSGGRGGRGGGGRSGAGSSIAGVGSRGGGGGRHYA) is a cationic peptide containing 
      48 amino acid residues (aa) with 12 basic aa and no acidic aa. The chemical 
      synthesized peptide efficiently killed bacteria and some fungal species including 
      clinically isolated drug-resistance microorganisms. The cDNA encoding 
      cathelicidin-AL precursor was cloned from the skin cDNA library of A. loloensis. As 
      other cathelicidins, the precursor of cathelicidin-AL also contains highly conserved 
      anionic cathelin domain of cysteine proteinase inhibitor followed by the AMP 
      fragment at C-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that as connecting link, the 
      amphibian cathelicidin predates reptilia but postdates fish cathelicidin. The 
      peptide purification combined with gene cloning results confirms the presence of 
      cathelicidin in amphibians and filled the evolutionary gap of cathelicidin in 
      vertebrate, considering amphibians' special niche as the animals bridging the 
      evolutionary land-water gap.

TI  - Identification of Miscellaneous Peptides from the Skin Secretion of the European 
      Edible Frog, Pelophylax kl. Esculentus.
PG  - 291-9
LID - 10.1007/s10930-016-9672-z [doi]
AB  - The chemical compounds synthesised and secreted from the dermal glands of amphibian 
      have diverse bioactivities that play key roles in the hosts' innate immune system 
      and in causing diverse pharmacological effects in predators that may ingest the 
      defensive skin secretions. As new biotechnological methods have developed, 
      increasing numbers of novel peptides with novel activities have been discovered from 
      this source of natural compounds. In this study, a number of defensive skin 
      secretion peptide sequences were obtained from the European edible frog, P. kl. 
      esculentus, using a 'shotgun' cloning technique developed previously within our 
      laboratory. Some of these sequences have been previously reported but had either 
      obtained from other species or were isolated using different methods. Two new skin 
      peptides are described here for the first time. Esculentin-2c and Brevinin-2Tbe 
      belong to the Esculentin-2 and Brevinin-2 families, respectively, and both are very 
      similar to their respective analogues but with a few amino acid differences. 
      Further, [Asn-3, Lys-6, Phe-13] 3-14-bombesin isolated previously from the skin of 
      the marsh frog, Rana ridibunda, was identified here in the skin of P. kl. 
      esculentus. Studies such as this can provide a rapid elucidation of peptide and 
      corresponding DNA sequences from unstudied species of frogs and can rapidly provide 
      a basis for related scientific studies such as those involved in systematic or the 
      evolution of a large diverse gene family and usage by biomedical researchers as a 
      source of potential novel drug leads or pharmacological agents.

TI  - Structure-activity relationship of an antibacterial peptide, maculatin 1.1, from the 
      skin glands of the tree frog, Litoria genimaculata.
PG  - 414-22
AB  - Maculatin 1.1 (Mac) is a cationic antibacterial peptide isolated from the dorsal 
      glands of the tree frog, Litoria genimaculata, and has a sequence of 
      GLFGVLAKVAAHVVPAIAEHF-NH2. A short peptide lacking the N-terminal two residues of 
      Mac was reported to have no activity. To investigate the structure-activity 
      relationship in detail, several analogs and related short peptides of Mac were 
      synthesized. CD measurement showed that all the peptides took more or less an 
      alpha-helical structure in the presence of anionic lipid vesicles. Analogs which are 
      more basic than Mac had strong antibacterial and hemolytic activities, while short 
      peptides lacking one or two terminal residues exhibited weak or no activity. Outer 
      and inner membrane permeabilization activities of the peptides were also reduced 
      with shortening of the peptide chain. These results indicate that the entire chain 
      length of Mac is necessary for full activity, and the basicity of the peptides 
      greatly affects the activity.

AB  - Aerolysins are virulence factors belonging to the bacterial β-pore-forming toxin 
      superfamily. Surprisingly, numerous aerolysin-like proteins exist in vertebrates, 
      but their biological functions are unknown. βγ-CAT, a complex of an aerolysin-like 
      protein subunit (two βγ-crystallin domains followed by an aerolysin pore-forming 
      domain) and two trefoil factor subunits, has been identified in frogs (Bombina 
      maxima) skin secretions. Here, we report the rich expression of this protein, in the 
      frog blood and immune-related tissues, and the induction of its presence in 
      peritoneal lavage by bacterial challenge. This phenomena raises the possibility of 
      its involvement in antimicrobial infection. When βγ-CAT was administrated in a 
      peritoneal infection model, it greatly accelerated bacterial clearance and increased 
      the survival rate of both frogs and mice. Meanwhile, accelerated Interleukin-1β 
      release and enhanced local leukocyte recruitments were determined, which may 
      partially explain the robust and effective antimicrobial responses observed. The 
      release of interleukin-1β was potently triggered by βγ-CAT from the frog peritoneal 
      cells and murine macrophages in vitro. βγ-CAT was rapidly endocytosed and 
      translocated to lysosomes, where it formed high molecular mass SDS-stable oligomers 
      (>170 kDa). Lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin B release were detected, which 
      may explain the activation of caspase-1 inflammasome and subsequent interleukin-1β 
      maturation and release. To our knowledge, these results provide the first functional 
      evidence of the ability of a host-derived aerolysin-like protein to counter 
      microbial infection by eliciting rapid and effective host innate immune responses. 
      The findings will also largely help to elucidate the possible involvement and action 
      mechanisms of aerolysin-like proteins and/or trefoil factors widely existing in 
      vertebrates in the host defense against pathogens.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a dynamic, complex, and well-organized process that 
      requires the orchestration of many different cell types and cellular processes. 
      Transforming growth factor β1 is an important factor that plays a key role during 
      wound healing. Amphibian skin has been proven to possess excellent wound healing 
      ability, whilst no bioactive substrate related to it has ever been identified. Here, 
      a potential wound healing-promoting peptide (AH90, ATAWDFGPHGLLPIRPIRIRPLCG) was 
      identified from the frog skin of Odorrana grahami. It showed potential wound 
      healing-promoting activity in a murine model with full thickness dermal wound. AH90 
      promoted release of transforming growth factor β1 through activation of nuclear 
      factor-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling 
      pathways, while inhibitors of nuclear factor-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 
      inhibited the process. In addition, the effects of AH90 on Smads family proteins, 
      key regulators in transforming growth factor β1 signaling pathways, could also be 
      inhibited by transforming growth factor β1 antibody. Altogether, this indicated that 
      AH90 promoted wound healing by inducing the release of transforming growth factor 
      β1. This current study may facilitate the understanding of effective factors 
      involved in the wound repair of amphibians and the underlying mechanisms as well. 
      Considering its favorable traits as a small peptide that greatly promoting 
      generation of endogenous wound healing agents (transforming growth factor β1) 
      without mitogenic effects, AH90 might be an excellent template for the future 
      development of novel wound-healing agents.

AB  - There is an urgent need to develop novel antimicrobial substances. Antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) are considered as promising candidates for future therapeutic use. 
      Because of the re-emergence of the Flavivirus infection, and particularly the yellow 
      fever virus (YFV), we have compared the antiviral activities from skin secretions of 
      seven different frog species against YFV (strain 17D). Secretions from 
      Sphaenorhynchus lacteus, Cryptobatrachus boulongeri and Leptodactylus fuscus 
      displayed the more powerful activities. S. lacteus was found to inhibit viral lysis 
      of Vero E6 cells even at the highest viral concentration evaluated of 10 LD(50). We 
      also report the identification of a novel frenatin-related peptide from S. lacteus 
      and found that this peptide-on its own-can lead to 35% protection against YVF, while 
      displaying no cytotoxicity against somatic cells even at fivefold higher 
      concentrations. These results are attractive and support the need for continued 
      exploration of new sources of AMPs from frog skin secretions such as those described 
      here in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases in 
      general and specific viral infections in particular.

AB  - The Uganda clawed frog Xenopus ruwenzoriensis with a karyotype of 2n=108 is one of 
      the very few vertebrates with dodecaploid status. Peptidomic analysis of 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from this species led to the isolation and 
      structural characterization of 23 host-defense peptides belonging to the following 
      families: magainin (3 peptides), peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa; 6 peptides), 
      xenopsin precursor fragment (XPF; 3 peptides), caerulein precursor fragment (CPF; 8 
      peptides), and caerulein precursor fragment-related peptide (CPF-RP; 3 peptides). In 
      addition, the secretions contained caerulein, identical to the peptide from Xenopus 
      laevis, and two peptides that were identified as members of the trefoil factor 
      family (TFF). The data indicate that silencing of the host-defense peptide genes 
      following polyploidization has been appreciable and non-uniform. Consistent with 
      data derived from comparison of nucleotide sequences of mitochrondrial and nuclear 
      genes, cladistic analyses based upon the primary structures of the host-defense 
      peptides provide support for an evolutionary scenario in which X. ruwenzoriensis 
      arose from an allopolyploidization event involving an octoploid ancestor of the 
      present-day frogs belonging to the Xenopus amieti species group and a tetraploid 
      ancestor of Xenopus pygmaeus.

AB  - Mammalian iron homeostasis is regulated by the interaction of the liver-produced 
      peptide hepcidin and its receptor, the iron transporter ferroportin. Hepcidin binds 
      to ferroportin resulting in degradation of ferroportin and decreased cellular iron 
      export. We identify the hepcidin-binding domain (HBD) on ferroportin and show that a 
      synthetic 19 amino acid peptide corresponding to the HBD recapitulates the 
      characteristics and specificity of hepcidin binding to cell-surface ferroportin. The 
      binding of mammalian hepcidin to ferroportin or the HBD shows an unusual temperature 
      dependency with an increased rate of dissociation at temperatures below 15 degrees 
      C. The increased rate of dissociation is due to temperature- dependent changes in 
      hepcidin structure. In contrast, hepcidin from poikilothermic vertebrates, such as 
      fish or frogs, binds the HBD in a temperature-independent fashion. The affinity of 
      hepcidin for the HBD permits a rapid, sensitive assay of hepcidin from all species 
      and yields insights into the evolution of hepcidin.

TI  - A family of acyclic brevinin-1 peptides from the skin of the Ryukyu brown frog Rana 
      okinavana.
PG  - 185-90
AB  - The 24 amino-acid residue antimicrobial peptide, brevinin-1 is synthesized in the 
      skins of a wide range of species of Eurasian and North American frogs belonging to 
      the genus Rana. All previously characterized brevinin-1 peptides contain the cyclic 
      heptapeptide domain Cys18-(Xaa)4-Lys-Cys24 at the COOH-terminus of the molecule. 
      Four structurally related peptides were isolated from an extract of the skin of the 
      Ryukyu brown frog Rana okinavana. The amino acid sequences of the peptides 
      [Phe-(Xaa)4-Ile-(Xaa)2-Leu-Ala-Lys-Gly-Leu-Pro-Ser-Leu-Ile-Xaa-Leu-Xaa-Lys-Lys.NH2] 
      identified them as members of the brevinin-1 family that lacked the COOH-terminal 
      cyclic domain but contained a C-terminally alpha-amidated residue. It is suggested, 
      as one possibility, that the Cys18 in the brevinin-1 consensus sequence has been 
      deleted and the Cys24 residue has mutated to a glycine that acts as substrate for 
      peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase. The peptides potently inhibited the 
      growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus confirming that a cyclic domain 
      is not necessary for antimicrobial activity. A fifth peptide 
      (SFLNFFKGAA10KNLLAAGLDK20LKCKISGTQC30), that also displayed broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial activity, was isolated from the skin extract and showed structural 
      similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously isolated from the skin 
      of North American ranid frogs.

AB  - Peptidomic analysis was used to compare the distribution of host-defense peptides in 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from Xenopus victorianusAhl, 1924 (also 
      described as the subspecies X. laevis victorianus) and Xenopus laevis 
      sudanensisPerret, 1966 with the previously determined distributions in Xenopus 
      laevis (Daudin, 1802) and Xenopus petersii Bocage, 1895. Peptides belonging to the 
      magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa), and caerulein precursor fragment 
      (CPF) families were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by 
      electrospray mass spectrometry. Magainin-P2, PGLa-P1, CPF-P1, CPF-P2, and CPF-P3 
      previously isolated from X. petersii and structurally different from orthologous 
      peptides from X. laevis, were identified in X. victorianus and X. laevis sudanensis 
      skin secretions whereas the corresponding X. laevis peptides were absent. 
      Magainin-1, identical in X. petersii and X. laevis, was also identified in the 
      secretions. Xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) peptides, absent from X. petersii but 
      present in X. laevis skin secretions, were not identified in the X. victorianus and 
      X. laevis sudanensis secretions. The data indicate that X. victorianus and X. laevis 
      sudanensis are more closely related to X. petersii than to X. laevis and support 
      separate species status. The study illustrates the value of analysis of host-defense 
      peptides in the evaluation of taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships between 
      closely related frog species.

LID - 10.1007/s00726-018-2551-5 [doi]
AB  - Long-standing Type 2 diabetes is associated with loss of both β-cell function and 
      β-cell mass. Peptides derived from the frog-skin host-defense peptide esculentin-1 
      have been shown to exhibit potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The aim of 
      the present study is to determine whether such peptides also show insulinotropic and 
      β-cell protective activities. Esculentin-1a(1-21).NH(2), esculentin-1b(1-18).NH(2), 
      and esculentin-1a(1-14).NH(2) produced concentration-dependent stimulations of 
      insulin release from BRIN-BD11 rat clonal β-cells, 1.1B4 human-derived pancreatic 
      β-cells, and isolated mouse islets with no cytotoxicity at concentrations of up to 
      3 μM. The mechanism of insulinotropic action involved membrane depolarization and an 
      increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. The analogue [D-Lys(14), 
      D-Ser(17)]esculentin-1a(1-21).NH(2) (Esc(1-21)-1c) was less potent in vitro than the 
      all L-amino acid containing peptides and esculentin-1a(9-21) was inactive indicating 
      that helicity is an important determinant of insulinotropic activity. However, 
      intraperitoneal injection of Esc(1-21)-1c (75 nmol/kg body weight) together with a 
      glucose load (18 mmol/kg body weight) in C57BL6 mice improved glucose tolerance with 
      a concomitant increase in insulin secretion, whereas administration of 
      esculentin-1a(1-21).NH(2), esculentin-1b(1-18).NH(2), and esculentin-1a(1-14) was 
      without significant effect on plasma glucose levels. Esc(1-21)-1c (1 µM) protected 
      BRIN-BD11 cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis (P < 0.01) and augmented 
      proliferation of the cells (P < 0.01) to a similar extent as glucagon-like 
      peptide-1. The data demonstrate that the multifunctional peptide Esc(1-21)-1c, as 
      well as showing therapeutic potential as an anti-infective and wound-healing agent, 
      may constitute a template for development of compounds for treatment of patients 
      with Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Immune evasion or avoidance: fungal skin infection linked to reduced defence

AB  - Many parasites and pathogens suppress host immunity to maintain infection or 
      initiate disease. On the skin of many amphibians, defensive peptides are active 
      against the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the causative agent of the 
      emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis. We tested the hypothesis that 
      infection with the fungus may be linked to lower levels of defensive peptides. We 
      sampled both ambient (or constitutive) skin peptides on the ventral surface 
      immediately upon capture, and stored skin peptides induced from granular glands by 
      norepinephrine administration of Australian green-eyed treefrogs, Litoria serrata. 
      Upon capture, uninfected frogs expressed an array of antimicrobial peptides on their 
      ventral surface, whereas infected frogs had reduced skin peptide expression. 
      Expression of ambient skin peptides differed with infection status, and 
      antimicrobial peptides maculatin 1.1 and 2.1 were on average three times lower on 
      infected frogs. However, the repertoire of skin peptides stored in granular glands 
      did not differ with infection status; on average equal quantities were recovered 
      from infected and from uninfected frogs. Our results could have at least two causes: 
      (1) frogs with reduced peptide expression are more likely to become infected; (2) Bd 
      infection interferes with defence peptides by inhibiting release or causing 
      selective degradation of peptides on the skin surface. Immune evasion therefore may 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of chytridiomycosis and a mechanistic understanding 
      of this fungal strategy may lead to improved methods of disease control.

AB  - Here, we report two novel peptides identified from the skin secretion, having 
      homologies to Lividin and Spinulosain, of an endemic frog, Hydrophylax bahuvistara, 
      of Western Ghats. This is the first report of these peptides from Indian frogs and 
      first identification of Lividin from the Hydrophylax genus. Both peptides exhibited 
      weak antimicrobial activity but very low haemolytic activity. The problems of naming 
      amphibian host defense peptides (HDPs) are also discussed.

TI  - Different expression profiles of bioactive peptides in Pelophylax nigromaculatus 
      from distinct regions.
PG  - 1075-9
AB  - Amphibian skin is an abundant repository of bioactive peptides, important components 
      of the defensive system. The variability of the bioactive peptide repertoires of 
      individual species remains unclear. In this study, dark-spotted frogs were collected 
      from Kunming in Yunnan Province, China and Guiyang in Guizhou Province, China to 
      determine whether the bioactive peptides in amphibian skin differ between the two 
      regions. Eight antimicrobial peptides and an antioxidant peptide were identified by 
      screening of cDNA library. Among the identified peptides, three antimicrobial 
      peptides (pelophylaxin-2GY, temporin-1GY, and temporin-1KM) and an antioxidant 
      peptide (antioxidin-PN) are reported here for the first time. Nigrocin-1, 
      nigrocin-2, and pelophylaxin-2 were expressed by frogs in both regions. 
      Pelophylaxin-2GY and temporin-1GY were found only in the frogs from Guiyang, whereas 
      antioxidin-PN, esculetin-1, esculetin-2, and temporin-1KM were found only in those 
      from Kunming. This difference was confirmed by allele-specific RT-PCR. The bioactive 
      peptides expressed clearly varied between these populations of the same species.

AB  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Endangered Cape Platanna 
      Xenopus gilli inhabits disjunct ranges at the tip of Cape Peninsula and near the 
      town of Kleinmond on opposite sides of False Bay in the extreme southwest of Africa. 
      Peptidomic analysis of host-defense peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
      secretions from frogs from the Cape Peninsula range resulted in the identification 
      of two magainins, two peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa) peptides, two 
      xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) peptides, nine caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF) 
      peptides, and a peptide related to peptide glycine-glutamine (PGQ) previously found 
      in an extract of Xenopus laevis stomach. The primary structures of the peptides 
      indicate a close phylogenetic relationship between X. gilli and X. laevis but only 
      magainin-1, PGLa and one CPF peptide are identical in both species. Consistent with 
      previous data, the CPF peptides show the greatest antimicrobial potency but are 
      hemolytic. There are appreciable differences in the expression of host-defense 
      peptide genes in frogs from the population of animals sampled near Kleinmond as 
      peptides corresponding to magainin-G2, XPF-G1, XPF-G2, and four CPF peptides, 
      present in secretions from the Cape Peninsula frogs, were not identified in the skin 
      secretions from Kleinmond frogs. Conversely, PGLa-G3, XPF-G3, and three CPF peptides 
      were identified in the Kleinmond frogs but not in the Cape Peninsula animals. The 
      data support the conclusion from morphometric analyses and comparisons of the 
      nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes that the disjunct populations of X. 
      gilli have undergone appreciable genetic, morphological, and phenotypic divergence.

AB  - Global amphibian declines due to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis 
      (Bd) have led to questions about how amphibians defend themselves against skin 
      diseases. A total of two amphibian defense mechanisms are antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs), a component of amphibian innate immune defense and symbiotic skin bacteria, 
      which can act in synergy. We characterized components of these factors in four 
      populations of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) to investigate their role 
      in disease defense. We surveyed the ability of their AMPs to inhibit Bd, skin 
      bacterial community composition, skin metabolite profiles and presence and intensity 
      of Bd infection. We found that AMPs from R. luteiventris inhibited Bd in bioassays, 
      but inhibition did not correlate with Bd intensity on frogs. R. luteiventris had two 
      prevalent and abundant core bacteria: Rhizobacter and Chryseobacterium. Rhizobacter 
      relative abundance was negatively correlated with AMP's ability to inhibit Bd, but 
      was not associated with Bd status itself. There was no relationship between 
      metabolites and Bd. Bacterial communities and Bd differ by location, which suggests 
      a strong environmental influence. R. luteiventris are dominated by consistent core 
      bacteria, but also house transient bacteria that are site specific. Our emergent 
      hypothesis is that host control and environmental factors shape the microbiota on R. 
      luteiventris.

TI  - Novel brevinins from Chinese piebald odorous frog (Huia schmackeri) skin deduced 
      from cloned biosynthetic precursors.
PG  - 1456-60
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.03.009 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides represent the most characterized and diverse class of 
      peptides within the defensive skin secretions of anuran amphibians. With an ever 
      expanding database of primary structures, the current accepted rules for 
      nomenclature have become increasingly difficult to apply to peptides whose primary 
      structural attributes are either unique or that fall between those that define 
      existing groups. An additional factor that adds to the confusion is the regular 
      re-classification or revision of existing taxa. In the present study, we have 
      identified five new antimicrobial peptide homologs in the defensive skin secretion 
      of the Chinese piebald odorous frog, Huia schmackeri (formerly Rana (Odorrana) 
      schmackeri), by cloning of their respective biosynthetic precursors. As these 
      peptides are obvious homologs of the brevinin-1 and brevinin-2 families we have 
      named these in accordance: (1) brevinin-1HS1, (2) brevinin-2HS1, (3) brevinin-2HS2, 
      (4) brevinin-2HS3 and (5) brevinin-1HS2. The reasons for adopting these names are 
      discussed. It is clear that with an ever-increasing number of amphibian skin 
      antimicrobial peptides appearing in the literature that a consistent nomenclature 
      scheme needs to be established.

PG  - 4230-40
LID - 10.1021/pr200393t [doi]
AB  - Tree frogs produce a variety of skin defensive chemicals against many biotic and 
      abiotic risk factors for their everyday survival. By proteomics or peptidomics and 
      coupling transcriptome analysis with pharmacological testings, 27 peptides or 
      proteins belonging to 9 families, which act mainly as defensive functions, were 
      identified and characterized from skin secretions of the tree frog, Hyla simplex. 
      They are: (1) a novel family of peptides with EGF- and VEGF-releasing activities; 
      (2) a novel family of analgesic peptides; (3) a family of neurotoxins acting on 
      sodium channel; (4) a snake venom-like presynaptically active neurotoxin; (5) a 
      snake venom-like neurotoxin targeting cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels; (6) a 
      tachykinin-like peptide, which is the first report from tree frogs; (7) two 
      antimicrobial peptides; (8) a alpha-1-antitrypsin-like serpin; and (9) a wasp 
      venom-like toxin with serine protease inhibitors activity. Families of 1, 2, 4, 5, 
      and 8 proteins or peptides are first reported in amphibians. The chemical array in 
      the tree frog skin shares some similarities with snake venoms. Most of these 
      components in this tree frog help defend against predators, heal wounds, or 
      attenuate suffering.

AB  - Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a 
      widespread disease of amphibians responsible for population declines and 
      extinctions. Some bacteria from amphibians' skins produce antimicrobial substances 
      active against Bd. Supplementing populations of these cutaneous antifungal bacteria 
      might help manage chytridiomycosis in wild amphibians. However, the activity of 
      protective bacteria may depend upon environmental conditions. Biocontrol of Bd in 
      nature thus requires knowledge of how environmental conditions affect their anti-Bd 
      activity. For example, Bd-driven amphibian declines have often occurred at 
      temperatures below Bd's optimum range. It is possible these declines occurred due to 
      reduced anti-Bd activity of bacterial symbionts at cool temperatures. Better 
      understanding of the effects of temperature on chytridiomycosis development could 
      also improve risk evaluation for amphibian populations yet to encounter Bd. We 
      characterized, at a range of temperatures approximating natural seasonal variation, 
      the anti-Bd activity of bacterial symbionts from the skins of three species of 
      rainforest tree frogs (Litoria nannotis, Litoria rheocola, and Litoria serrata). All 
      three species declined during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 
      1990s and have subsequently recovered to differing extents. We collected anti-Bd 
      bacterial symbionts from frogs and cultured the bacteria at constant temperatures 
      from 8 °C to 33 °C. Using a spectrophotometric assay, we monitored Bd growth in 
      cell-free supernatants (CFSs) from each temperature treatment. CFSs from 11 of 24 
      bacteria showed reduced anti-Bd activity in vitro when they were produced at cool 
      temperatures similar to those encountered by the host species during population 
      declines. Reduced anti-Bd activity of metabolites produced at low temperatures may, 
      therefore, partially explain the association between Bd-driven declines and cool 
      temperatures. We show that to avoid inconsistent antifungal activity, bacteria 
      evaluated for use in chytridiomycosis biocontrol should be tested over a range of 
      environmental temperatures spanning those likely to be encountered in the field.

AB  - Sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies present a great risk to 
      the reproductive health of women. Therefore, female-controlled vaginal products 
      directed toward disease prevention and contraception are needed urgently. In the 
      present study, efforts were made to evaluate the contraceptive potency of 
      dermaseptin DS4, an antimicrobial peptide derived from frog skin. To assess the 
      structure-activity relationship between the native DS4 and its derivatives, a set of 
      chemically modified peptides was synthesized and evaluated. Normal human semen 
      samples were used to detect the spermicidal activity of the new compounds. HeLa 
      cultures were used to determine the safety of compounds toward their toxicity. 
      Fluorescent-binding assays were performed to evaluate the rapidity and the 
      irreversibility of the sperm-immobilizing activity of peptides. All DS4 derivatives 
      elicited concentration-dependent spermicidal activity at microgram concentrations 
      (EC(100) values: 25 microg/ml-l mg/ml). The order was 
      K4S4=S4a>S4>K4S4(1-16)a>S4(6-28). In cytotoxicity assay, some compounds were found 
      to be significantly safer than nonoxynol-9, the most widely used spermicide, and 
      their activity was not accompanied by total loss of plasma membrane integrity as 
      detected by fluorescent microscopy. Our data also show that increasing the number of 
      positive charges of the peptide resulted in a reduced cytotoxicity without affecting 
      the spermicidal effect. This study indicates that dermaseptins are spermicidal 
      molecules that deserve to be tested as topical contraceptive with useful activities 
      that can add to their prophylaxis, safety, and effectiveness.

AB  - Phylloseptin-1, -2, and -3 are three members of the family of linear cationic 
      antimicrobial peptides found in tree frogs. The highly homologous peptides encompass 
      19 amino acids, and only differ in the amino acid composition and charge at the six 
      most carboxy-terminal residues. Here, we investigated how such subtle changes are 
      reflected in their membrane interactions and how these can be correlated to their 
      biological activities. To this end, the three peptides were labeled with stable 
      isotopes, reconstituted into oriented phospholipid bilayers, and their detailed 
      topology determined by a combined approach using (2)H and (15)N solid-state NMR 
      spectroscopy. Although phylloseptin-2 and -3 adopt perfect in-plane alignments, the 
      tilt angle of phylloseptin-1 deviates by 8° probably to assure a more water exposed 
      localization of the lysine-17 side chain. Furthermore, different azimuthal angles 
      are observed, positioning the amphipathic helices of all three peptides with the 
      charged residues well exposed to the water phase. Interestingly, our studies also 
      reveal that two orientation-dependent (2)H quadrupolar splittings from 
      methyl-deuterated alanines and one (15)N amide chemical shift are sufficient to 
      unambiguously determine the topology of phylloseptin-1, where quadrupolar splittings 
      close to the maximum impose the most stringent angular restraints. As a result of 
      these studies, a strategy is proposed where the topology of a peptide structure can 
      be determined accurately from the labeling with (15)N and (2)H isotopes of only a 
      few amino acid residues.

AB  - Recent global declines, extirpations and extinctions of wildlife caused by newly 
      emergent diseases highlight the need to improve our knowledge of common 
      environmental factors that affect the strength of immune defense traits. To achieve 
      this goal, we examined the influence of acidification and shading of the larval 
      environment on amphibian skin-associated innate immune defense traits, pre and 
      post-metamorphosis, across two populations of American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), 
      a species known for its wide-ranging environmental tolerance and introduced global 
      distribution. We assessed treatment effects on 1) skin-associated microbial 
      communities and 2) post-metamorphic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production and 3) 
      AMP bioactivity against the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). 
      While habitat acidification did not affect survival, time to metamorphosis or 
      juvenile mass, we found that a change in average pH from 7 to 6 caused a significant 
      shift in the larval skin microbial community, an effect which disappeared after 
      metamorphosis. Additionally, we found shifts in skin-associated microbial 
      communities across life stages suggesting they are affected by the physiological or 
      ecological changes associated with amphibian metamorphosis. Moreover, we found that 
      post-metamorphic AMP production and bioactivity were significantly affected by the 
      interactions between pH and shade treatments and interactive effects differed across 
      populations. In contrast, there were no significant interactions between treatments 
      on post-metamorphic microbial community structure suggesting that variation in AMPs 
      did not affect microbial community structure within our study. Our findings indicate 
      that commonly encountered variation in the larval environment (i.e. pond pH and 
      degree of shading) can have both immediate and long-term effects on the amphibian 
      innate immune defense traits. Our work suggests that the susceptibility of 
      amphibians to emerging diseases could be related to variability in the larval 
      environment and calls for research into the relative influence of potentially less 
      benign anthropogenic environmental changes on innate immune defense traits.

AB  - The subfamily Phyllomedusinae has attracted a great interest of many researchers 
      mainly due to the high diversity of these frog species and plethora of 
      pharmacological activities frequently observed for their skin secretions. Despite of 
      this fact, mainly for new species, limited information is available regarding the 
      molecular composition of these skin secretions and the cellular components involved 
      in their production. Phyllomedusa nordestina is a recently described Brazilian frog 
      species also popularly known as 'tree-frogs'. Aiming at contributing to the 
      biological knowledge of this species, we show here the gene expression profile of 
      this frog skin secretion using a global ESTs analysis of a cDNA library. The marked 
      aspect of this analysis revealed a significant higher transcriptional level of the 
      opioid peptide dermorphins in P. nordestina skin secretion than in Phyllomedusa 
      hypochondrialis, which is its closest related species, belonging both to the same 
      phylogenetic group. Precursors of bioactive peptides as dermaseptins, phylloseptins, 
      tryptophyllins, and bradykinin-like peptideswere also found in this library. 
      Transcripts encoding proteins related to ordinary cellular functions and pathways 
      were also described. Some of them are chiefly involved in the production of the skin 
      secretion. Taken together, the data reported here constitute a contribution to the 
      characterization of the molecular diversity of gene-encoded polypeptides with 
      potential possibility of pharmacological exploitation. The transcriptional 
      composition of the skin secretion may also help to give the necessary support for 
      the definition of P. nordestina as a new species, which actually relies basically on 
      frog morphological characteristics and geographical distribution.

TI  - Elements of the granular gland peptidome and transcriptome persist in air-dried skin 
      of the South American orange-legged leaf frog, Phyllomedusa hypocondrialis.
PG  - 2129-36
AB  - The defensive strategy of amphibians against predator attack relies heavily on the 
      secretion of noxious/toxic chemical cocktails from specialized skin granular glands. 
      Bioactive peptides constitute a major component of secretions in many species and 
      the most complex are produced by neotropical leaf frogs of the sub-family 
      Phyllomedusinae. We recently reported that these skin secretions contain elements of 
      both the granular gland peptidome and transcriptome and that polyadenylated mRNAs 
      constituting the latter are protected from degradation by interactions with 
      endogenous amphipathic peptides. This thus permits parallel amino acid sequencing of 
      peptides and nucleic acid sequencing of cloned precursor transcripts from single 
      lyophilized samples of secretion. Here we report that the protection afforded is 
      sufficiently robust to permit transcriptome studies by cloning of full-length 
      polyadenylated peptide precursor encoding mRNAs from libraries constructed using 
      ambient temperature air-dried skin from recently deceased specimens as source 
      material. The technique was sufficiently sensitive to permit the identification of 
      cDNAs encoding antimicrobial peptides constituted by six different isoforms of 
      phylloseptin and two dermaseptins. Also, for the first time, establishment of the 
      nucleic acid and amino acid sequence of the precursor encoding the phyllomedusine 
      frog skin bradykinin-related peptide, phyllokinin, from cloned cDNA, was achieved. 
      These data unequivocally demonstrate that the granular gland transcriptome persists 
      in air-dried amphibian skin--a finding that may have fundamental implications in the 
      study of archived materials but also in the wider field of molecular biology.

TI  - A novel peptide Phylloseptin-PBu from Phyllomedusa burmeisteri possesses 
      insulinotropic activity via potassium channel and GLP-1 receptor signalling.
PG  - 2804-2814
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13573 [doi]
AB  - Insulin, as one of the most important hormones regulating energy metabolism, plays 
      an essential role in maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis in vivo. Failure or 
      insufficiency of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells increases glucose and 
      free fatty acid level in circulation and subsequently contributes to the emergence 
      of hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. Therefore, stimulating the insulin release 
      benefits the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity significantly. Frog skin 
      peptides have been extensively studied for their biological functions, among which, 
      Phylloseptin peptides discovered in Phyllomedusinae frogs have been found to exert 
      antimicrobial, antiproliferative and insulinotropic activities, while the mechanism 
      associated with Phylloseptin-induced insulin secretion remains elusive. In this 
      study, we reported a novel peptide named Phylloseptin-PBu, isolated and identified 
      from Phyllomedusa burmeisteri, exhibited dose-dependent insulinotropic property in 
      rat pancreatic beta BRIN-BD11 cells without altering cell membrane integrity. 
      Further mechanism investigations revealed that Phylloseptin-PBu-induced insulin 
      output is predominantly modulated by K(ATP) -[K(+) ] channel depolarization 
      triggered extracellular calcium influx and GLP-1 receptor initiated PKA signalling 
      activation. Overall, our study highlighted that this novel Phylloseptin-PBu peptide 
      has clear potential to be developed as a potent antidiabetic agent with established 
      function-traced mechanism and low risk of cytotoxicity.

TI  - Peptidomic analysis of skin secretions from the bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus 
      (Ranidae) identifies multiple peptides with potent insulin-releasing activity.
PG  - 203-8
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.11.002 [doi]
AB  - Using a combination of reversed-phase HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry, 
      peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the American 
      bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus Shaw, 1802 led to the identification and 
      characterization of five newly described peptides (ranatuerin-1CBb, ranatuerin-2CBc, 
      and -CBd, palustrin-2CBa, and temporin-CBf) together with seven peptides previously 
      isolated on the basis of their antimicrobial activity (ranatuerin-1CBa, 
      ranatuerin-2CBa, brevinin-1CBa, and -1CBb, temporin-CBa, -CBb, and -CBd). The 
      abilities of the most abundant of the purified peptides to stimulate the release of 
      insulin from the rat BRIN-BD11 clonal β cell line were evaluated. Ranatuerin-2CBd 
      (GFLDIIKNLGKTFAGHMLDKIRCTIGTCPPSP) was the most potent peptide producing a 
      significant stimulation of insulin release (119% of basal rate, P<0.01) from 
      BRIN-BD11 cells at a concentration of 30nM, with a maximum response (236% of basal 
      rate, P<0.001) at a concentration of 3μM. Ranatuerin-2CBd did not stimulate release 
      of the cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase at concentrations up to 3μM, 
      indicating that the integrity of the plasma membrane had been preserved. 
      Brevinin-1CBb (FLPFIARLAAKVFPSIICSVTKKC) produced the maximum stimulation of insulin 
      release (285% of basal rate, P<0.001 at 3μM) but the peptide was cytotoxic at this 
      concentration.

TI  - Skin secretion peptides: the molecular facet of the deimatic behavior of the 
      four-eyed frog, Physalaemus nattereri (Anura, Leptodactylidae).
PG  - 2061-8
LID - 10.1002/rcm.7313 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Amphibians can produce a large amount of bioactive peptides over the 
      skin. In order to map the precise tissue localization of these compounds and 
      evaluate their functions, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and gene expression 
      studies were used to investigate a possible correlation between molecules involved 
      in the antimicrobial defense mechanisms and anti-predatory behavior by Physalaemus 
      nattereri. METHODS: Total skin secretion of P. nattereri was analyzed by classical 
      Protein Chemistry and proteomic techniques. Intact inguinal macroglands were 
      dissected from the rest of the skin and both tissues were analyzed by MSI and 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. Peptides were primarily 
      identified by de novo sequencing, automatic Edman degradation and cDNA data. 
      RESULTS: Fifteen bradykinin (BK)-related peptides and two antimicrobial peptides 
      were sequenced and mapped by MSI on the inguinal macrogland and the rest of P. 
      nattereri skin. RT-PCR results revealed that BK-related peptide levels of expression 
      were about 30,000 times higher on the inguinal macroglands than on the any other 
      region of the skin, whilst antimicrobial peptide ions appear to be evenly 
      distributed in both investigated regions. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antimicrobial 
      peptides in all investigated tissue regions is in accordance with the defensive role 
      against microorganisms thoroughly demonstrated in the literature, whereas BK-related 
      molecules are largely found on the inguinal macroglands suggesting an intriguing 
      link between their noxious activities against potential predators of P. nattereri 
      and the frog's deimatic behavior.

TI  - One pathogen two stones: are Australian tree frog antimicrobial peptides synergistic 
      against human pathogens?
PG  - 639-646
LID - 10.1007/s00249-017-1215-9 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may act by targeting the lipid membranes and 
      disrupting the bilayer structure. In this study, three AMPs from the skin of 
      Australian tree frogs, aurein 1.2, maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1, were investigated 
      against Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, and 
      vesicles that mimic their lipid compositions. Furthermore, equimolar mixtures of the 
      peptides were tested to identify any synergistic interactions in antimicrobial 
      activity. Minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration 
      assays showed significant activity against S. aureus but not against E. coli. Aurein 
      was the least active while maculatin was the most active peptide and some 
      synergistic effects were observed against S. aureus. Circular dichroism experiments 
      showed that, in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, the peptides transitioned 
      from an unstructured to a predominantly helical conformation (>50%), with greater 
      helicity for POPG/TOCL compared to POPE/POPG vesicles. The helical content, however, 
      was less in the presence of live E. coli and S. aureus, 25 and 5%, respectively. 
      Equimolar concentrations of the peptides did not appear to form greater 
      supramolecular structures. Dye release assays showed that aurein required greater 
      concentration than caerin and maculatin to disrupt the lipid bilayers, and mixtures 
      of the peptides did not cooperate to enhance their lytic activity. Overall, aurein, 
      maculatin, and caerin showed moderate synergy in antimicrobial activity against S. 
      aureus without becoming more structured or enhancement of their membrane-disrupting 
      activity in phospholipid vesicles.

TI  - Identification of <10 KD peptides in the water extraction of Venenum Bufonis from 
      Bufo gargarizans using Nano LC-MS/MS and De novo sequencing.

AB  - Skins of anurans (frogs and toads) are rich sources of bioactive peptides. However, 
      the peptides secreted by the skin glands of Bufo gargarizans, the most common toad 
      in China, remained unexplored to date. Here, a strategy combines LC-MS/MS, RNA 
      sequencing and bioinformation analysis was applied to unravel the peptides in the 
      Bufo gargarizans secretions. Data-dependent LC-MS/MS acquisitions of intact peptides 
      followed by automated chromatographic alignment, De novo analysis, database and 
      homology searches with manual validations showed that the venom is composed by 939 
      features, with masses ranging from 0.7-4 kDa. These peptides derived from 85 
      proteins were identified using the PEAKS software with acquired MS and MS/MS spectra 
      of Venenum Bufonis against the house-built protein database using De novo RNA 
      sequencing, while only 23 peptides from 8 proteins were found when searching known 
      amphibian database. Moreover, it was found that many peptides with high abundance in 
      Venenum Bufonis derived from proteolytic processing of a larger precursor protein, 
      named as CL4590. Molecular cloning was applied to validate a short domain of CL4590 
      to evident the accuracy of these obtained sequences. Although the bioactivities of 
      peptides identified by MS/MS are unknown, the next function annotation showed that 
      they may involve in the cell killing, immune and metabolic process, antioxidant 
      activity and antimicrobial actions. Therefore, the peptidomics analysis on Bufo 
      gargarizans discover abundant novel toad peptides which broaden our horizons on the 
      secretion multiplicity and supplied an assortment of pharmacological candidates.

TI  - [In vitro activities of Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin against 5 
      pathogenic bacteria].
PG  - 1807-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides 
      from skin against 5 pathogenic bacteria, include 2 wild strains and 7 resistant 
      strains. METHODS: Broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test was used for 
      bacteria that growed aerobically. RESULTS: The 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial 
      peptides were basically in vitro efficient agents for inhibition against to 
      methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCN, 85460), wild 
      Staphylococcus aureus (24157), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP, 
      84688 and 91452), class I beta-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae (AmpC, 85439 and 
      93543), wild Escherichia coli (84492), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases Escherichia 
      coli (ESBL, 84492), inhabitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase Escherichia coli (IRT, 
      85580). CONCLUSION: The 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin have 
      broad spectrum antimicrobial activity; especially have in vitro activity to 
      resistant strains. So it is hopeful to be developed as the antimicrobial agent as 
      well as the disinfectant and the antiseptic.

TI  - Microbiota and skin defense peptides may facilitate coexistence of two sympatric 
      Andean frog species with a lethal pathogen.
PG  - 361-373
LID - 10.1038/s41396-018-0284-9 [doi]
AB  - Management of hyper-virulent generalist pathogens is an emergent global challenge, 
      yet for most disease systems we lack a basic understanding as to why some host 
      species suffer mass mortalities, while others resist epizootics. We studied two 
      sympatric species of frogs from the Colombian Andes, which coexist with the 
      amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), to understand why some 
      species did not succumb to the infection. We found high Bd prevalence in juveniles 
      for both species, yet infection intensities remained low. We also found that 
      bacterial community composition and host defense peptides are specific to amphibian 
      life stages. We detected abundant Bd-inhibitory skin bacteria across life stages and 
      Bd-inhibitory defense peptides post-metamorphosis in both species. Bd-inhibitory 
      bacteria were proportionally more abundant in adults of both species than in earlier 
      developmental stages. We tested for activity of peptides against the skin microbiota 
      and found that in general peptides did not negatively affect bacterial growth and in 
      some instances facilitated growth. Our results suggest that symbiotic bacteria and 
      antimicrobial peptides may be co-selected for, and that together they contribute to 
      the ability of Andean amphibian species to coexist with the global pandemic lineage 
      of Bd.

TI  - Temporins, small antimicrobial peptides with leishmanicidal activity.
PG  - 984-90
AB  - Leishmaniasis encompasses a wide range of infections caused by the human parasitic 
      protozoan species belonging to the Leishmania genus. It appears frequently as an 
      opportunistic disease, especially in virus-infected immunodepressed people. 
      Similarly to other pathogens, parasites became resistant to most of the first-line 
      drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop antiparasitic agents with new 
      modes of action. Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides are promising candidates, but 
      so far only a few of them have shown anti-protozoa activities. Here we found that 
      temporins A and B, 13-amino acid antimicrobial peptides secreted from the skin of 
      the European red frog Rana temporaria, display anti-Leishmania activity at 
      micromolar concentrations, with no cytolytic activity against human erythrocytes. To 
      the best of our knowledge, temporins represent the shortest natural peptides having 
      the highest leishmanicidal activity and the lowest number of positively charged 
      amino acids (a single lysine/arginine) and maintain biological function in serum. 
      Their lethal mechanism involves plasma membrane permeation based on the following 
      data. (i) They induce a rapid collapse of the plasma membrane potential. (ii) They 
      induce the influx of the vital dye SYTOX Green. (iii) They reduce intracellular ATP 
      levels. (iv) They severely damage the membrane of the parasite, as shown by 
      transmission electron microscopy. Besides giving us basic important information, the 
      unique properties of temporins, as well as their membranolytic effect, which should 
      make it difficult for the pathogen to develop resistance, suggest them as potential 
      candidates for the future design of antiparasitic drugs with a new mode of action.

TI  - Structures of the glycine-rich diastereomeric peptides bombinin H2 and H4.
PG  - 246-54
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.05.011 [doi]
AB  - Skin secretions of the European frog Bombina variegata contain a family of 
      hydrophobic peptides, called bombinins H, which probably play a role in the defense 
      against microbes. These peptides are rich in glycine (25%), which may allow 
      structural polymorphism. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that bombinin H can, 
      dependent on the environment, adopt different conformations. Moreover, some of these 
      peptides contain a d-amino acid; the bombinins H2 and H4 differ from each other in 
      that they contain either L-Ile or D-allo-Ile at position 2. In this paper we report 
      the solution structure obtained by using NMR techniques of the mainly helical 
      conformation, which these peptides adopt upon binding to the bilayer mimetics SDS 
      and DPC. A glycine ridge is exposed at one side of the helix and may provide a 
      helix-helix interaction site. In this respect, the structure of bombinin H resembles 
      the influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide and the helical conformer of Alzheimer 
      peptide Abeta(25-40). Neither structure nor orientation of bombinin H are affected 
      by the chiral inversion. Environmental conditions can trigger self-aggregation of 
      bombinin H in solution due to hydrophobic interaction. Under these conditions the 
      stereochemistry of the randomly ordered N-terminal segment modulates the preference 
      to fold into a particular conformation.

TI  - Identification of novel peptides from amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis) skin by direct 
      tissue MALDI-MS analysis.
PG  - 102-13
LID - 10.1111/febs.13107 [doi]
AB  - Twelve novel peptides (Pxt-1 to Pxt-12) were isolated from the skin of 
      Xenopus tropicalis, diploid frogs, using topological MS analysis. Among them, Pxt-8, 
      Pxt-9, and Pxt-10 were the N terminus of Pxt-1, N terminus of Pxt-3 and C terminus 
      of Pxt-11, respectively. The Pxt-3 and Pxt-11 peptides shared significant sequence 
      homologies with magainins 1, -2 and levitide, respectively, which all isolated from 
      X. laevis. Pxt-12 was identical to the X. tropicalis XT-6-like precursor previously 
      isolated by ESI-MS/MS. None of the Pxt peptides contained any Cys, Asp, Tyr or Trp, 
      although Leu and Lys were frequently found as typical frog-skin peptides. RT-PCR 
      analysis confirmed the gene expressions of Pxt-2, Pxt-3, Pxt-4, Pxt-5, Pxt-7 and 
      Pxt-11 in X. tropicalis skin. Several ion peaks corresponding to all identified Pxt 
      peptides were observed with MALDI-MS analysis of X. tropicalis secretory fluids, 
      collected after in vivo stimulation, which suggested that Pxt peptides were 
      definitely secretory molecules. CD studies and Schiffer-Edmundson helical wheel 
      projections suggested that Pxt-5, as well as mastoparan, at least, could form a 
      typical amphiphilic α helix without a phospholipid or a membrane-mimetic solvent 
      (trifluoroethanol). Moreover, Pxt-2 and Pxt-5 showed growth inhibitory effects on 
      both Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive). 
      Measurements of dynamic light scattering and the surface tensions of Pxt peptides 
      solutions suggested that both Pxt-2 and Pxt-5 could form associations as micelles 
      and behave like a general surfactant. Moreover, the remarkable foaming properties of 
      Pxt-2 and Pxt-5 were observed, as well as those of the secretory fluids of 
      X. tropicalis.

TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analyses of preprotemporin mRNAs containing premature 
      stop codons from extradermal tissues of Rana tagoi.
PG  - 2124-8
AB  - The temporins are a family of hydrophobic, C-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial 
      peptides that are synthesized in the skins of a wide range of species of frogs 
      belonging to the genus Rana. In the present study, we investigated using RT-PCR the 
      expression of preprotemporin mRNAs in extradermal tissues of Tago's brown frog Rana 
      tagoi. cDNAs encoding temporin-1TGa (FLPILGKLLS(10)GIL.NH2), previously isolated 
      from an extract of the skin of R. tagoi skin, were amplified and cloned from the 
      stomach, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle. However, a net insertion of 10 nucleotides 
      resulted in the presence of a premature stop codon in the open reading frame that 
      was not present in the corresponding region of preprotemporin-1TGa from skin. The 
      preprotemporin cDNA obtained from small intestine contained an additional 12 
      nucleotide insertion in the region that encodes the temporin sequence so that a 
      novel peptide (FLPVILPVIG(10)KLLSGIL.NH2), termed temporin-1TGc, is specified. This 
      cDNA also contained a premature stop codon in the open reading frame. Although it is 
      unclear whether temporin-1TGc is produced in R. tagoi tissues, a synthetic replicate 
      of the peptide of was biologically active, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus 
      aureus (minimal inhibitory concentration = 37.5 microM) and producing hemolysis of 
      human erythrocytes (LD50 = 50 microM).

TI  - Assessment of the potential of temporin peptides from the frog Rana temporaria 
      (Ranidae) as anti-diabetic agents.
LID - 10.1002/psc.3065 [doi]
AB  - Temporin A (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH(2) ), temporin F (FLPLIGKVLSGIL-NH(2) ), and temporin G 
      (FFPVIGRILNGIL-NH(2) ), first identified in skin secretions of the frog Rana 
      temporaria, produced concentration-dependent stimulation of insulin release from 
      BRIN-BD11 rat clonal β-cells at concentrations ≥1 nM, without cytotoxicity at 
      concentrations up to 3 μM. Temporin A was the most effective. The mechanism of 
      insulinotropic action did not involve an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) 
      concentrations. Temporins B, C, E, H, and K were either inactive or only weakly 
      active. Temporins A, F, and G also produced a concentration-dependent stimulation of 
      insulin release from 1.1B4 human-derived pancreatic β-cells, with temporin G being 
      the most potent and effective, and from isolated mouse islets. The data indicate 
      that cationicity, hydrophobicity, and the angle subtended by the charged residues in 
      the temporin molecule are important determinants for in vitro insulinotropic 
      activity. Temporin A and F (1 μM), but not temporin G, protected BRIN-BD11 cells 
      against cytokine-induced apoptosis (P < 0.001) and augmented (P < 0.001) 
      proliferation of the cells to a similar extent as glucagon-like peptide-1. 
      Intraperitoneal injection of temporin G (75 nmol/kg body weight) together with a 
      glucose load (18 mmol/kg body weight) in C57BL6 mice improved glucose tolerance with 
      a concomitant increase in insulin secretion whereas temporin A and F administration 
      was without significant effect on plasma glucose levels. The study suggests that 
      combination therapy involving agents developed from the temporin A and G sequences 
      may find application in Type 2 diabetes treatment.

TI  - Antibacterial activities of temporin A analogs.
PG  - 6-9
AB  - Temporin A (TA) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide 
      (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) found in the skin of the European red frog, Rana temporaria. It 
      has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, 
      including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains. In this 
      investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural characteristics of TA 
      synthetic analogs were studied. For antibacterial activity against S. aureus and 
      enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the N-terminal amino acid of TA was 
      found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino acid position 7, and 
      bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. Replacing isoleucine with 
      leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of 
      antibacterial activity. In addition, there was little difference between the 
      activities of TA and its all-D enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably 
      exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.

TI  - Novel dermaseptin, adenoregulin and caerin homologs from the Central American 
      red-eyed leaf frog, Agalychnis callidryas, revealed by functional peptidomics of 
      defensive skin secretion.
PG  - 1435-41
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.04.016 [doi]
AB  - By integrating systematic peptidome and transcriptome studies of the defensive skin 
      secretion of the Central American red-eyed leaf frog, Agalychnis callidryas, we have 
      identified novel members of three previously described antimicrobial peptide 
      families, a 27-mer dermaseptin-related peptide (designated DRP-AC4), a 33-mer 
      adenoregulin-related peptide (designated ARP-AC1) and most unusually, a 27-mer 
      caerin-related peptide (designated CRP-AC1). While dermaseptin and adenoregulin were 
      originally isolated from phyllomedusine leaf frogs, the caerins, until now, had only 
      been described in Australian frogs of the genus, Litoria. Both the dermaseptin and 
      adenoregulin were C-terminally amidated and lacked the C-terminal tripeptide of the 
      biosynthetic precursor sequence. In contrast, the caerin-related peptide, unlike the 
      majority of Litoria analogs, was not C-terminally amidated. The present data 
      emphasize the need for structural characterization of mature peptides to ensure that 
      unexpected precursor cleavages and/or post-translational modifications do not 
      produce mature peptides that differ in structure to those predicted from cloned 
      biosynthetic precursor cDNA. Additionally, systematic study of the secretory 
      peptidome can produce unexpected results such as the CRP described here that may 
      have phylogenetic implications. It is thus of the utmost importance in the 
      functional evaluation of novel peptides that the primary structure of the mature 
      peptide is unequivocally established -- something that is often facilitated by 
      cloning biosynthetic precursor cDNAs but obviously not reliable using such data 
      alone.

TI  - Molecular cloning and multifunctional characterization of host defense peptides from 
      the bullfrog Harderian gland with special reference to catesbeianalectin.
PG  - 185-91
LID - 10.2108/zsj.30.185 [doi]
AB  - The Harderian gland (HG) is an orbital gland found in many terrestrial vertebrates 
      that possess a nictitating membrane. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR), we cloned five cDNAs encoding antimicrobial peptide 
      (AMP)-homologs, catesbeianalectin, ranacyclin-CBa, ranatuerin-1CBa, ranatuerin-2CBa, 
      and ranatuerin-2CBb, from the bullfrog HG total RNA. Of these, catesbeianalectin has 
      not been thoroughly studied in terms of its biological activities. We examined 
      antimicrobial activities of the synthetic replicate of catesbeianalectin and its 
      putative unprocessed precursor, catesbeianalectin-GK. Both peptides showed slight 
      but significant growth inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacterium 
      Escherichia coli. Subsequently, we tested catesbeianalectin and catesbeianalectin-GK 
      for mast cell degranulation activity as a criterion of the release of 
      N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase from the mouse-derived mastocytoma cell line P-815, 
      followed by the standard MTT assay to assess cell survival and recovery after 
      peptide treatment. We found that catesbeianalectin and catesbeianalectin-GK 
      invariably exhibited mast cell degranulation activity without cytotoxic effects. 
      Hemagglutination assay revealed the presence of lectin-like activity in both 
      catesbeianalectin and catesbeianalectin-GK. Our findings strongly suggest that these 
      multifunctional host defense peptides in the amphibian HG are involved in innate 
      immunodefense of the eye of the host against pathogenic environmental 
      microorganisms.

TI  - NMR structures and interactions of temporin-1Tl and temporin-1Tb with 
      lipopolysaccharide micelles: mechanistic insights into outer membrane 
      permeabilization and synergistic activity.
PG  - 24394-406
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.189662 [doi]
AB  - Temporins are a group of closely related short antimicrobial peptides from frog 
      skin. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of the outer membrane of 
      gram-negative bacteria, plays important roles in the activity of temporins. Earlier 
      studies have found that LPS induces oligomerization of temporin-1Tb (TB) thus 
      preventing its translocation across the outer membrane and, as a result, reduces its 
      activity on gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, temporin-1Tl (TL) exhibits 
      higher activity, presumably because of lack of such oligomerization. A synergistic 
      mechanism was proposed, involving TL and TB in overcoming the LPS-mediated barrier. 
      Here, to gain insights into interactions of TL and TB within LPS, we investigated 
      the structures and interactions of TL, TB, and TL+TB in LPS micelles, using NMR and 
      fluorescence spectroscopy. In the context of LPS, TL assumes a novel antiparallel 
      dimeric helical structure sustained by intimate packing between aromatic-aromatic 
      and aromatic-aliphatic residues. By contrast, independent TB has populations of 
      helical and aggregated conformations in LPS. The LPS-induced aggregated states of TB 
      are largely destabilized in the presence of TL. Saturation transfer difference NMR 
      studies have delineated residues of TL and TB in close contact with LPS and enhanced 
      interactions of these two peptides with LPS, when combined together. Fluorescence 
      resonance energy transfer and (31)P NMR have pointed out the proximity of TL and TB 
      in LPS and conformational changes of LPS, respectively. Importantly, these results 
      provide the first structural insights into the mode of action and synergism of 
      antimicrobial peptides at the level of the LPS-outer membrane.

TI  - Characterization of naturally occurring peptides in the skin secretion of Rana 
      pipiens frog reveal pipinin-1 as the novel insulin-releasing agent.
PG  - 204-10
AB  - Naturally occurring insulinotropic peptides were isolated from the skin secretions 
      of Rana pipiens frogs. Crude secretions (50 mg; 5-10 frogs) obtained by mild 
      electrical stimulation of the dorsal skin surface were purified by reversed-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) yielding 80 fractions. In acute 
      incubations with glucose-responsive BRIN-BD11 cells, fractions 40-47 (band 1) and 
      fractions 60-65 (band 2) showed significant 1.7-6.7-fold increases in 
      insulin-releasing activity (P < 0.001) compared with 5.6 mm glucose alone. Pooled 
      fractions in bands 1 and 2 were rechromatographed yielding a total of seven peaks 
      capable of subsequent 1.2-1.8-fold stimulation of insulin release. Final 
      purification by HPLC to single homogenous peaks revealed one prominent peptide (peak 
      4.1) with insulin-releasing activity which lacked effects on cell viability. 
      Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of this peptide indicated molecular mass of 
      2562.6 Da. Determination of the primary amino acid sequence of this peptide revealed 
      a 24-amino acid sequence: FLPIIAGVAAKVFPKIFCAISKKC. Database search showed a 100% 
      homology to histamine-releasing pipinin-1. In conclusion, this study revealed the 
      skin secretions of Rana pipiens to be a rich source of insulin-releasing peptides. 
      The discovery of insulinotropic activity for pipinin-1, initially characterized as 
      an antimicrobial is interesting and merits further investigation.

      cruzi activity without cytotoxicity to mammalian cells.
PG  - 49332-40
AB  - Amphibian skin secretions are known as a rich source of biologically active 
      molecules, most of which are alkaloids, biogenic amines, and peptides. Dermaseptins 
      are a class of antimicrobial peptides present in tree frogs of the Phyllomedusa 
      genus. They are cationic molecules of 28-34 residues that permeabilize the membrane 
      of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, showing 
      little or no hemolytic activity. This work reports the isolation, molecular mass 
      analysis, primary structure determination, biological activities, and potential 
      therapeutic applications of an antimicrobial peptide found in the skin secretion of 
      Phyllomedusa oreades, which is a newly described amphibian species endemic of the 
      Brazilian savanna. DS 01 is a 29-residue-long peptide with a molecular mass of 
      2793.39 Da showing antibacterial properties against Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
      bacteria in the range of 3-25 microm. Anti-protozoan activity was investigated using 
      T. cruzi in its trypomatigote and epimastigote forms cultivated in both cell culture 
      and blood media. Within 2 h after incubation with DS 01 at a final concentration of 
      approximately 6 microm, no protozoan cells were detected. Two synthetic 
      dermaseptins, described previously by our group and named dermadistinctins K and L 
      (DD K and DD L), also had their anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity investigated and 
      demonstrated similar properties. Toxicity of DS 01 to mouse erythrocytes and white 
      blood cells was evaluated by means of atomic force microscopy and flow cytometry. No 
      morphological alterations were observed at a lytic concentration of DS 01, 
      suggesting its therapeutic value especially as an anti-T. cruzi agent to prevent 
      infections during blood transfusion.

PG  - 150-4
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpc.2009.04.003 [doi]
AB  - Peptide-based defenses of ranid frogs from Mexico and Central America have been 
      studied in much less detail than those from North America. Peptides belonging to the 
      brevinin-1 (5 peptides), palustrin-2 (1 peptide), and ranatuerin-2 (3 peptides) 
      families were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the Costa 
      Rican frog, Lithobates vaillanti (Ranidae) and characterized structurally. 
      Brevinin-1VLa (FLGAIAGVAAKFLPKVFCFITKKC) and brevinin-1VLc (FLPVIASVAAKVLPK 
      VFCFITKKC) showed particularly high growth-inhibitory potency (MIC < or =3 microM) 
      against a Gram-positive microorganism Staphylococcus aureus and the opportunistic 
      yeast pathogen Candida albicans and potent cytolytic activity (LC(50)< or =8 microM) 
      against both human erythrocytes and HepG2 hepatoma-derived cells. The peptides were 
      also active against a Gram-negative microorganism Escherichia coli (MIC< or =50 
      microM). Substitutions in brevinin-1VLd (Lys(11) --> Asn) and brevinin-1VLe (Lys(11) 
      --> Ser) that decrease cationicity result in loss of activity against E. coli. 
      Ranatuerin-2VLb (GIMDTIKGAAKDLAGQLLDKLKCKITKC) showed relatively weak antimicrobial 
      activity (MIC> or =75 microM) but selective cytolytic activity against HepG2 tumor 
      cells (LC(50)=30 microM) compared with erythrocytes (LC(50)>200 microM). In 
      addition, a dodecapeptide (RICYAMWIPYPC) were isolated from the secretions that were 
      devoid of antimicrobial activity. This component contains an Ala-Met bond that 
      constitutes the scissile bond in the selective elastase inhibitor, elafin but the 
      peptide did not inhibit pancreatic elastase at concentrations up to 100 microM.

TI  - Peptidomic analysis of skin secretions demonstrates that the allopatric populations

LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.05.025 [doi]
AB  - Mueller's clawed frog Xenopus muelleri (Peters 1844) occupies two non-contiguous 
      ranges in east and west Africa. The phylogenetic relationship between the two 
      populations is unclear and it has been proposed that the western population 
      represents a separate species. Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
      secretions from X. muelleri from the eastern range resulted in the identification of 
      five antimicrobial peptides structurally related to the magainins (magainin-M1 and 
      -M2), xenopsin-precursor fragments (XPF-M1) and caerulein-precursor fragments 
      (CPF-M1 and -M2) previously found in skin secretions of other Xenopus species. A 
      cyclic peptide (WCPPMIPLCSRF.NH₂) containing the RFamide motif was also isolated 
      that shows limited structural similarity to the tigerinins, previously identified 
      only in frogs of the Dicroglossidae family. The components identified in skin 
      secretions from X. muelleri from the western range comprised one magainin 
      (magainin-MW1), one XPF peptide (XPF-MW1), two peptides glycine-leucine amide 
      (PGLa-MW1 and -MW2), and three CPF peptides (CPF-MW1, -MW2 and -MW3). Comparison of 
      the primary structures of these peptides suggest that western population of X. 
      muelleri is more closely related to X. borealis than to X. muelleri consistent with 
      its proposed designation as a separate species. The CPF peptides showed potent, 
      broad-spectrum activity against reference strains of bacteria (MIC 3-25 μM), but 
      were hemolytic against human erythrocytes.

TI  - Immunomodulation in post-metamorphic northern leopard frogs, Lithobates pipiens, 
      following larval exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether.
PG  - 5910-9
LID - 10.1021/es405776m [doi]
AB  - Pollutants and disease are factors implicated in amphibian population declines, and 
      it is hypothesized that these factors exert a synergistic adverse effect, which is 
      mediated by pollutant-induced immunosuppression. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers 
      (PBDEs) are ubiquitous pollutants that can exert immunotoxicity, making them of 
      interest to test effects on amphibian immune function. We orally exposed Lithobates 
      (Rana) pipiens tadpoles to environmentally realistic levels (0-634 ng/g wet diet) of 
      a pentabromodiphenyl ether mixture (DE-71) from as soon as they became free-swimming 
      through metamorphic climax. To assess adaptive immune response in juvenile frogs, we 
      used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure specific IgY production 
      following immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Specific KLH antibody 
      response was significantly decreased in juvenile frogs that had been exposed to 
      PBDEs as tadpoles. When assessing innate immune responses, we found significantly 
      different neutrophil counts among treatments; however, phagocytic activity of 
      neutrophils was not significantly different. Secretion of antimicrobial skin 
      peptides (AMPs) nonsignificantly decreased with increasing PBDE concentrations, and 
      no significant effect of PBDE treatment was observed on efficacy of AMPs to inhibit 
      chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) growth. Our findings demonstrate 
      that environmentally realistic concentrations of PBDEs are able to alter immune 
      function in frogs; however, further research is needed to determine how these 
      alterations impact disease susceptibility in L. pipiens.

AB  - Skin secretions from anurans (frogs and toads), particularly those species belonging 
      to the Hylidae and Ranidae families, are a rich source of biologically active 
      peptides. Cytolytic peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and highly 
      variable amino acid sequences are often released into these secretions in high 
      concentrations. Identification and characterization of these components can prove to 
      be valuable in species identification, elucidation of evolutionary histories and 
      phylogenetic relationships between species, and may lead to development of agents 
      with potential for therapeutic application. This chapter describes the use of 
      norepinephrine (injection or immersion) to stimulate peptide release in a procedure 
      that does not appear to cause distress to the animals. The peptide components in the 
      secretions are separated by reversed-phase HPLC on octadecylsilyl silica (C(18)) 
      columns under standard conditions after partial purification on Sep-Pak cartridges. 
      Individual peptides are identified by determination of their molecular masses by 
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and from their retention times. The use of mixtures of 
      synthetic peptides of appropriate molecular mass as calibration standards enables 
      mass determination to a high degree of precision.

TI  - Brevinin-1 and multiple insulin-releasing peptides in the skin of the frog Rana 
      palustris.
PG  - 347-54
AB  - Few studies have comprehensively examined amphibian granular gland secretions for 
      novel insulinotropic peptides. This study involved isolation and characterisation of 
      biologically active peptides from the skin secretions of Rana palustris frogs. Crude 
      secretions obtained by mild electrical stimulation from the dorsal skin surface were 
      purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a semipreparative Vydac C18 column, yielding 80 
      fractions. These fractions were assayed for insulin-releasing activity using 
      glucose-responsive BRIN-BD11 cells. Acute 20 min incubations were performed in Krebs 
      Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 5.6 mmol/l glucose in the absence 
      (control) and presence of various fractions. Fractions 29-54 and fractions 68-75 
      showed significant 2.0-6.5-fold increases in insulin-releasing activity (P<0.001). 
      The fractions showing most prominent insulinotropic activity were further purified 
      to single homogeneous peaks, which, on testing, evoked 1.5-2.8-fold increases in 
      insulin release (P<0.001). The structures of the purified peptides were determined 
      by mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Electrospray ionisation 
      ion-trap mass spectrometry analysis revealed molecular masses of 2873.5-8560.4 Da. 
      Sufficient material was isolated to determine the primary amino acid sequence of the 
      2873.5 Da peptide, revealing a 27 amino acid sequence, ALSILRGLEKLAKMGIALTNCKATKKC, 
      repressing palustrin-1c. The database search for this peptide showed a 48% homology 
      with brevinin-1, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from various Rana species, which 
      itself stimulated insulin release from BRIN-BD11 cells in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. In conclusion, the skin secretions of R. palustris frogs contain a novel 
      class of peptides with insulin-releasing activity that merit further investigation.

AB  - Host-defense peptides and proteins are vital for first line protection against 
      bacteria. Most host-defense peptides and proteins common in vertebrates have been 
      studied primarily in mammals, while their orthologues in non-mammalian vertebrates 
      received less attention. We found that the European Common Frog Rana temporaria 
      expresses a protein in its skin that is evolutionarily related to the host-defense 
      protein S100A7. This prompted us to test if the encoded protein, which is an 
      important microbicidal protein in human skin, shows similar activity in frogs. The 
      R. temporaria protein lacks the zinc-binding sites that are key to the antimicrobial 
      activity of human S100A7 at neutral pH. However, despite being less potent, the 
      R. temporaria protein does compromise bacterial membranes at low pH, similar to its 
      human counterpart. We postulate that, while amphibian S100A7 likely serves other 
      functions, the capacity to compromise bacterial cell membranes evolved early in 
      tetrapod evolution.

TI  - Purification, Conformational Analysis, and Properties of a Family of Tigerinin 
      Peptides from Skin Secretions of the Crowned Bullfrog Hoplobatrachus occipitalis.
PG  - 2350-6
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00494 [doi]
AB  - Four host-defense peptides belonging to the tigerinin family (tigerinin-1O: 
      RICTPIPFPMCY; tigerinin-2O: RTCIPIPLVMC; tigerinin-3O: RICTAIPLPMCL; and 
      tigerinin-4O: RTCIPIPPVCF) were isolated from skin secretions of the African crowned 
      bullfrog Hoplobatrachus occipitalis. In aqueous solution at pH 4.8, the cyclic 
      domain of tigerinin-2O adopts a rigid amphipathic conformation that incorporates a 
      flexible N-terminal tail. The tigerinins lacked antimicrobial (MIC > 100 μM) and 
      hemolytic (LC50 > 500 μM) activities but, at a concentration of 20 μg/mL, 
      significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by peritoneal 
      cells from C57BL/6 mice without affecting production of IL-10 and IL-17. 
      Tigerinin-2O and -4O inhibited IFN-γ production at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL. 
      The tigerinins significantly (P ≤ 0.05) stimulated the rate of insulin release from 
      BRIN-BD11 clonal β-cells without compromising the integrity of the plasma membrane. 
      Tigerinin-1O was the most potent (threshold concentration 1 nM) and the most 
      effective (395% increase over basal rate at a concentration of 1 μM). Tigerinin-4O 
      was the most potent and effective peptide in stimulating the rate of glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 release from GLUTag enteroendocrine cells (threshold concentration 10 nM; 
      289% increase over basal rate at 1 μM). Tigerinin peptides have potential for 
      development into agents for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Bacterial Community Analysis on the Skin of Odorrana grahami and Proposal of 
      Comamonas aquatica subsp. aquatica subsp. nov. and Comamonas aquatica subsp. rana 
      subsp. nov.
PG  - 470-477
LID - 10.1007/s00284-019-01648-1 [doi]
AB  - Several studies indicated that Odorrana grahami (O. grahami) skin contains abundant 
      antimicrobial peptides, and the skin was recognized as hostile habitat for 
      microorganisms. In this study, the microbial community was evaluated by 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing, and two associated bacterial isolates were obtained and 
      characterized from the skin of O. grahami. Sixteen bacterial genera were identified 
      from the O. grahami skin by uncultured clone sequences. The dominant groups were 
      Comamonas, Bacillus and Morganella, and the genus Comamonas was the most abundant 
      group (41.7% of the total) of the community. Fortunately, strains CW-25(T) and 
      CW-518 belonging to genus Comamonas were isolated by plating dilutions. The 
      polyphasic taxonomy results indicated that strain CW-25(T) was a member of Comamonas 
      aquatica, it showed much higher antimicrobials resistance than the closest C. 
      aquatica strains of LMG 2370(T), LMG5937 and LMG 6112 isolated from freshwater. 
      Based on the polyphasic taxonomic studies and antimicrobials resistance 
      characteristics, two subspecies of Comamonas aquatica subsp. aquatica nov. and 
      Comamonas aquatica subsp. rana nov. were proposed. The super-antimicrobial 
      resistance endows the strains of Comamonas aquatica subsp. rana inhabit the O. 
      grahami skin, and the primary defense of O. grahami might be composed by the 
      antimicrobial peptides and the native bacteria.

TI  - Characterization and Biological Activities of Ocellatin Peptides from the Skin 
      Secretion of the Frog Leptodactylus pustulatus.
PG  - 1495-504
LID - 10.1021/np500907t [doi]
AB  - Eight new peptides were isolated from the skin secretion of the frog Leptodactylus 
      pustulatus and their amino acid sequences determined by de novo sequencing and by 
      cDNA cloning. Structural similarities between them and other antimicrobial peptides 
      from the skin secretion of Leptodactylus genus frogs were found. Ocellatins-PT1 to 
      -PT5 (25 amino acid residues) are amidated at the C-terminus, while ocellatins-PT6 
      to -PT8 (32 amino acid residues) have free carboxylates. Antimicrobial activity, 
      hemolytic tests, and cytotoxicity against a murine fibroblast cell line were 
      investigated. All peptides, except for ocellatin-PT2, have antimicrobial activity 
      against at least one Gram-negative strain. Ocellatin-PT8 inhibited the growth of 
      Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella 
      choleraesuis strains with MICs in the 60-240 μM range. No significant effect was 
      observed in human erythrocytes and in a murine fibroblast cell line after exposure 
      to the peptides at MICs. A comparison between sequences obtained by both direct 
      HPLC-MS de novo sequencing and cDNA cloning demonstrates the secretion of mature 
      peptides derived from a pre-pro-peptide structure.

TI  - Amelioration of radiation-induced skin injury by HIV-TAT-mediated protein 
      transduction of RP-1 from Rana pleurade.
PG  - 44-51
LID - 10.7150/ijms.7463 [doi]
AB  - Radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage DNA and most other 
      biological macromolecules in skin and radiation-induced skin injury is a serious 
      concern for radiation therapy. Skin possesses an extremely efficient antioxidant 
      system, which is conferred by two systems: antioxidant enzymes and small molecules 
      that can scavenge ROS by donating electrons. Amphibian skin is a multifunctional 
      organ, which protects against dangers of various oxidative stresses. Recently, a 
      small peptide called RP-1 was isolated from the skin secretions of Rana pleurade, 
      which shows strong antioxidant activity. However, this RP-1 peptide is limited 
      because its inability to across the cell membrane. Protein transduction domains 
      (PTDs) have demonstrated high efficiency for facilitating the internalization of 
      both homologous and heterogeneous proteins into cells. This study aims to elucidate 
      the protective effects of a HIV-TAT (TAT) PTD-coupled RP-1 fusion protein (TAT-RP1) 
      on radiation-induced skin injury in vitro and in vivo. The synthesized fusion 
      TAT-RP1 peptide can be incorporated into human keratinocyte HaCaT cells in a dose- 
      and time-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. We then evaluated the protective 
      role of TAT-RP1 against ionizing radiation. TAT-RP1 supplementation increased 
      anti-superoxide anion ability of HaCaT cells and decreased HaCaT cell 
      radiosensitivity to irradiation. Moreover, TAT-RP1 was able to penetrate the skin of 
      rats, entering epidermis as well as the dermis of the subcutaneous layer in skin 
      tissue. Topical spread of TAT-RP1 promoted the amelioration of radiation-induced 
      skin damage in rats. These results suggest that TAT-RP1 has potential as a protein 
      therapy for radiation-induced skin injury.

AB  - Transcriptome profiles provide a practical and inexpensive alternative to explore 
      genomic data in non-model organisms, particularly in amphibians where the genomes 
      are very large and complex. The odorous frog Odorranamargaretae (Anura: Ranidae) is 
      a dominant species in the mountain stream ecosystem of western China. Limited 
      knowledge of its genetic background has hindered research on this species, despite 
      its importance in the ecosystem and as biological resources. Here we report the 
      transcriptome of O. margaretae in order to establish the foundation for genetic 
      research. Using an Illumina sequencing platform, 62,321,166 raw reads were acquired. 
      After a de novo assembly, 37,906 transcripts were obtained, and 18,933 transcripts 
      were annotated to 14,628 genes. We functionally classified these transcripts by Gene 
      Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A total of 11,457 
      unique transcripts were assigned to 52 GO terms, and 1,438 transcripts were assigned 
      to 128 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we identified 27 potential antimicrobial peptides 
      (AMPs), 50,351 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites, and 2,574 microsatellite 
      DNA loci. The transcriptome profile of this species will shed more light on its 
      genetic background and provide useful tools for future studies of this species, as 
      well as other species in the genus Odorrana. It will also contribute to the 
      accumulation of amphibian genomic data.

TI  - Temporin L: antimicrobial, haemolytic and cytotoxic activities, and effects on 
      membrane permeabilization in lipid vesicles.
PG  - 91-100
AB  - The temporins are a family of small, linear antibiotic peptides with intriguing 
      biological properties. We investigated the antibacterial, haemolytic and cytotoxic 
      activities of temporin L (FVQWFSKFLGRIL-NH2), isolated from the skin of the European 
      red frog Rana temporaria. The peptide displayed the highest activity of temporins 
      studied to date, against both human erythrocytes and bacterial and fungal strains. 
      At variance with other known temporins, which are mainly active against 
      Gram-positive bacteria, temporin L was also active against Gram-negative strains 
      such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa A.T.C.C. 15692 and Escherichia coli D21 at 
      concentrations comparable with those that are microbiocidal to Gram-positive 
      bacteria. In addition, temporin L was cytotoxic to three different human tumour cell 
      lines (Hut-78, K-562 and U-937), causing a necrosis-like cell death, although 
      sensitivity to the peptide varied markedly with the specific cell line tested. A 
      study of the interaction of temporin L with liposomes of different lipid 
      compositions revealed that the peptide causes perturbation of bilayer integrity of 
      both neutral and negatively charged membranes, as revealed by the release of a 
      vesicle-encapsulated fluorescent marker, and that the action of the peptide is 
      modulated to some extent by membrane lipid composition. In particular, the presence 
      of negatively charged lipids in the model bilayer inhibits the lytic power of 
      temporin L. We also show that the release of fluorescent markers caused by temporin 
      L is size-dependent and that the peptide does not have a detergent-like effect on 
      the membrane, suggesting that perturbation of bilayer organization takes place on a 
      local scale, i.e. through the formation of pore-like openings.

AB  - Cathelicidins, a class of gene-encoded effector molecules of vertebrate innate 
      immunity, provide a first line of defense against microbial invasions. Although 
      cathelicidins from mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes have been extensively 
      studied, little is known about cathelicidins from amphibians. Here we report the 
      identification and characterization of two cathelicidins (cathelicidin-RC1 and 
      cathelicidin-RC2) from the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. The cDNA sequences (677 and 
      700 bp, respectively) encoding the two peptides were successfully cloned from the 
      constructed lung cDNA library of R. catesbeiana. And the deduced mature peptides are 
      composed of 28 and 33 residues, respectively. Structural analysis indicated that 
      cathelicidin-RC1 mainly assumes an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation, while 
      cathelicidin-RC2 could not form stable amphipathic structure. Antimicrobial and 
      bacterial killing kinetic analysis indicated that the synthetic cathelicidin-RC1 
      possesses potent, broad-spectrum and rapid antimicrobial potency, while 
      cathelicidin-RC2 exhibited very weak antimicrobial activity. Besides, the 
      antimicrobial activity of cathelicidin-RC1 is salt-independent and highly stable. 
      Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that cathelicidin-RC1 kills 
      microorganisms through the disruption of microbial membrane. Moreover, 
      cathelicidin-RC1 exhibited low cytotoxic activity against mammalian normal or tumor 
      cell lines, and low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes. The potent, 
      broad-spectrum and rapid antimicrobial activity combined with the salt-independence, 
      high stability, low cytotoxic and hemolytic activities make cathelicidin-RC1 an 
      ideal template for the development of novel peptide antibiotics.

PG  - 185-90
AB  - Gaegurin 4 (GGN4) is a member of the antimicrobial peptide subfamily isolated from 
      the skin of Rana rugosa. We cloned gDNA encoding GGN4 to study its gene organization 
      and regulation of expression. The GGN4 gene occurs in single copy in the R. rugosa 
      genome and contains a single intron of about 3.4 kb. The transcription start site is 
      located 68 bases upstream of the translation initiation codon. The GGN4 gene was 
      expressed both in Xenopus kidney epithelial cells (A6) and in Xenopus oocytes using 
      the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene system. The 5' flanking region 
      of the GGN4 gene contains a dl binding site that is known to regulate acute phase 
      immune response related gene expression in mammals and insects. The dl protein bound 
      specifically to the GGN4 gene promoter region. Mutants that serially delete the 5' 
      flanking region show that removal of the dl binding site inhibited GGN4 gene 
      expression in both A6 cells and Xenopus oocytes. From these results, we propose that 
      expression of the GGN4 gene may be regulated by the region containing the dl element 
      which plays a key role in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide genes in 
      Drosophila and mammals.

AB  - HPLC elution profile and MALDI TOF MS analysis of electro-stimulated skin secretion 
      of the Indian Ranid frog Clinotarsus curtipes of the Western Ghats confirmed the 
      presence of multiple peptides. Peptides eluted out of the C18 column at higher 
      hydrophobic solvent region showed antibacterial activity against diverse bacterial 
      strains, including the clinical isolates of V. cholerae and methicillin resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Peptidomic analysis of the most potent chromatographic 
      effluent fraction identified five novel peptide amides having sequence homology with 
      brevinin family. These peptides are named as brevinin1CTcu1 (B1CTcu1) to 
      brevinin1CTcu5 (B1CTcu5). Peptide B1CTcu1 is non-haemolytic while the others are 
      haemolytic in nature but all elicited potential antibacterial activity. B1CTcu5 is a 
      twenty-one residue peptide amide having proline hinge region in the middle and the 
      typical C-terminal intramolecular disulfide-bridged hepta peptide domain (Rana box) 
      that is present in most of the brevinin peptides. Analysis of their killing kinetics 
      with E. coli and S. aureus and the ability to induce membrane depolarization proved 
      that these are two independent events. These novel multifunctional peptides play an 
      important role to protect C. curtipes from invading pathogenic microorganisms 
      present in the environment.

AB  - Population declines due to chytridiomycosis among frogs belonging to the Amerana 
      (Rana boylii) species group from western North America have been particularly 
      severe. Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from the Oregon spotted frog Rana 
      pretiosa Baird and Girard, 1853 were collected from individuals that had been 
      previously infected with the causative agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis but had 
      proved resistant to developing chytridiomycosis. These secretions contained a more 
      diverse array of antimicrobial peptides than found in other species from the Amerana 
      group and 14 peptides were isolated in pure form. Determination of their primary 
      structures identified the peptides as esculentin-2PRa and -2PRb; ranatuerin-2PRa, 
      -2PRb, -2PRc, -2PRd, and -2PRe; brevinin-1PRa, -1PRb, -1PRc, and -1PRd; and 
      temporin-PRa, -PRb, and -PRc. The strongly cationic ranatuerin-2PRd and the 
      esculentin-2 peptides, which have not been identified in the secretions of other 
      Amerana species except for the closely related R. luteiventris, showed the highest 
      growth inhibitory potency against microorganisms. The strongly hydrophobic 
      brevinin-1PRd was the most cytotoxic to erythrocytes. Although no clear correlation 
      exists between production of dermal antimicrobial peptides by a species and its 
      resistance to fatal chytridiomycosis, the diversity of these peptides in R. pretiosa 
      may be pivotal in defending the species against environmental pathogens such as B. 
      dendrobatidis.

TI  - Direct visualization of membrane leakage induced by the antibiotic peptides: 
      maculatin, citropin, and aurein.
PG  - 1874-81
AB  - Membrane lysis caused by antibiotic peptides is often rationalized by means of two 
      different models: the so-called carpet model and the pore-forming model. We report 
      here on the lytic activity of antibiotic peptides from Australian tree frogs, 
      maculatin 1.1, citropin 1.1, and aurein 1.2, on POPC or POPC/POPG model membranes. 
      Leakage experiments using fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the peptide/lipid 
      mol ratio necessary to induce 50% of probe leakage was smaller for maculatin 
      compared with aurein or citropin, regardless of lipid membrane composition. To gain 
      further insight into the lytic mechanism of these peptides we performed single 
      vesicle experiments using confocal fluorescence microscopy. In these experiments, 
      the time course of leakage for different molecular weight (water soluble) 
      fluorescent markers incorporated inside of single giant unilamellar vesicles is 
      observed after peptide exposure. We conclude that maculatin and its related peptides 
      demonstrate a pore-forming mechanism (differential leakage of small fluorescent 
      probe compared with high molecular weight markers). Conversely, citropin and aurein 
      provoke a total membrane destabilization with vesicle burst without sequential probe 
      leakage, an effect that can be assigned to a carpeting mechanism of lytic action. 
      Additionally, to study the relevance of the proline residue on the membrane-action 
      properties of maculatin, the same experimental approach was used for maculatin-Ala 
      and maculatin-Gly (Pro-15 was replaced by Ala or Gly, respectively). Although a 
      similar peptide/lipid mol ratio was necessary to induce 50% of leakage for POPC 
      membranes, the lytic activity of maculatin-Ala and maculatin-Gly decreased in 
      POPC/POPG (1:1 mol) membranes compared with that observed for the naturally 
      occurring maculatin sequence. As observed for maculatin, the lytic action of 
      Maculatin-Ala and maculatin-Gly is in keeping with the formation of pore-like 
      structures at the membrane independently of lipid composition.

TI  - Cytotoxic peptides with insulin-releasing activities from skin secretions of the 
      Italian stream frog Rana italica (Ranidae).
PG  - 769-776
LID - 10.1002/psc.3025 [doi]
AB  - Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from Italian stream 
      frog Rana italica led to the purification and characterization of two host-defense 
      peptides differing by a single amino acid residue belonging to the brevinin-1 family 
      (brevinin-1ITa and -1ITb), a peptide belonging to the temporin family (temporin-ITa) 
      and a component identified as prokineticin Bv8. The secretions contained relatively 
      high concentrations of the methionine-sulphoxide forms of brevinin-1ITa and -1ITb 
      suggesting that these peptides may have a role as antioxidants in the skin of this 
      montane frog. Brevinin-1ITa (IVPFLLGMVPKLVCLITKKC) displayed potent cytotoxicity 
      against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (LC(50)  = 18 μM), breast 
      adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells (LC(50)  = 8 μM) and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 
      cells (LC(50)  = 18 μM), but the peptide was also strongly hemolytic against mouse 
      erythrocytes (LC(50)  = 7 μM). Temporin-ITa (VFLGAIAQALTSLLGKL.NH(2) ) was between 
      three and fivefold less potent against these cells. Brevinin-1ITa inhibited growth 
      of both Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli 
      as well as a strain of the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida parapsilosis, whereas 
      temporin-ITa was active only against S. epidermidis and C. parapsilosis. Both 
      peptides stimulated the release of insulin from BRIN-BD11 clonal β-cells at 
      concentrations ≥1 nM, but brevinin-1ITa was cytotoxic to the cells at concentrations 
      ≥3 μM. Copyright © 2017 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - A family of brevinin-2 peptides with potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      from the skin of the Hokkaido frog, Rana pirica.
PG  - 135-41
AB  - Nine peptides displaying varying degrees of antimicrobial activity were extracted 
      from the skin of the Hokkaido frog, Rana pirica. Five structurally related peptides 
      were identified as members of the brevinin-2 family. These peptides were active 
      against reference strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Gram-positive 
      (Staphlococcus aureus) bacteria but displayed relatively low hemolytic activity. The 
      most abundant peptide, brevinin-2PRa (680 nmol/g weight of dry skin) showed high 
      potency [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 6 and 12 microM] 
      against a range of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. In addition, activity was 
      unaffected by NaCl concentrations up to 200 mM. Cladistic analysis based on the 
      primary structures of brevinin-2 peptides supports a close phylogenetic relationship 
      between R. pirica and Japanese mountain brown frog Rana ornativentris. One peptide 
      of the ranatuerin-2 family and one strongly hemolytic peptide of the brevinin-1 
      family were also isolated from the extract along with two members of the temporin 
      family, temporin-1PRa (ILPILGNLLNGLL.NH(2)) and temporin-1PRb (ILPILGNLLNSLL.NH(2)) 
      that atypically lacked basic amino acid residues and showed only very weak 
      antimicrobial and hemolytic activity.

PG  - 83-90
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides in the skin secretions of anurans constitute a component of 
      the innate immunity that protects the organism against invading pathogens. Four 
      peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated in high yield from 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the Northern red-legged frog Rana 
      aurora aurora and their primary structures determined. Ranatuerin-2AUa 
      (GILSSFKGVAKGVAKNLAGKLLDELKCKITGC) showed potent growth-inhibitory activity against 
      a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations < 20 microM) but low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes 
      (50% hemolysis at 290 microM). Brevinin-1AUa (FLPILAGLAAKLVPKVFCSITKKC) and 
      brevinin-1AUb (FLPILAGLAANILPKVFCSITKKC) also showed potent antimicrobial activity 
      but were strongly hemolytic (HC50 < 10 microM). Temporin-1AUa (FLPIIGQLLSGLL.NH2) 
      atypically lacked a basic amino acid residue and showed very weak antimicrobial and 
      hemolytic activity. Its biological function remains to be established. The primary 
      structures of the antimicrobial peptides are consistent with a close phylogenetic 
      relationship between R. aurora, Rana boylii and Rana luteiventris.

AB  - Temporins are antimicrobial peptides secreted by the granular glands of the European 
      red frog (Rana temporaria). They are 10-14 amino acid long polypeptides active 
      prevalently against gram positive bacteria. This study shows that a synthetic 
      temporin B analogue (TB-YK), acquires the capacity to act in synergism with temporin 
      A and to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity in vivo against gram 
      positive and gram negative bacteria. Administration of 3.4 mg/Kg of temporin A 
      (TA)+1.6 mg/Kg TB-YK, given to individual mice concurrently with a lethal dose of 
      bacteria (gram positive or negative), rescued 100% of the animals. More importantly, 
      the same doses of temporins, administered one week after experimental infection with 
      a sub lethal dose of bacteria, sterilized 100% of the animals within 3-6 days. Also, 
      it is described an animal model based on the use of sub lethal doses of bacteria, 
      which closely mimics bacterial infection in humans. The model offers the possibility 
      to test in a preclinical setting the true potential of TA and TB-YK in combination 
      as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents.

TI  - Secretory ranalexin produced in recombinant Pichia pastoris exhibits additive or 
      synergistic bactericidal activity when used in combination with polymyxin B or 
      linezolid against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
PG  - 110-9
AB  - Ranalexin, a cationic peptide from frogs, is a potent therapeutic antimicrobial 
      peptide (AMP). Its limited availability is an obstacle for a wider application. A 
      high-level production of AMPs via bioengineering is possible but remains a 
      challenging task. In the current study, we investigated the potential antibacterial 
      properties of recombinant ranalexin, expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. A 78-bp 
      DNA fragment encoding the mature ranalexin peptide with a 6-His tag on its 
      C-terminus was designed using the preferred codon usage of P. pastoris. The gene was 
      inserted into pPICZaA and transformed into competent cells of P. pastoris strain 
      KM71. The yield of secretory ranalexin reached up to ~6 mg/L culture. Time-kill 
      curve analysis of ranalexin against both Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) demonstrated a concentration- dependent rapid 
      bactericidal activity. In checkerboard assays, the combinations of ranalexin with 
      the established antibiotics polymyxin B or linezolid reduced the MIC additively in 
      most tested bacteria. Time-kill assays indicated a significant synergism in E. coli 
      and MRSA when ranalexin was used in combination with antibiotics, even at 
      concentrations of 1/4 MIC or 1/2 MIC of ranalexin, respectively. Thus we propose 
      that secretory ranalexin produced in P. pastoris could be a useful tool to unravel 
      ranalexin’s biological function and for use in future in vivo studies against multi- 
      resistant bacterial infections.

TI  - D-Amino acids incorporation in the frog skin-derived peptide esculentin-1a(1-21)NH2 
      is beneficial for its multiple functions.
PG  - 2505-19
LID - 10.1007/s00726-015-2041-y [doi]
AB  - Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising future 
      antibiotics. We have previously isolated esculentin-1a(1-21)NH2, a short peptide 
      derived from the frog skin AMP esculentin-1a, with a potent anti-Pseudomonal 
      activity. Here, we investigated additional functions of the peptide and properties 
      responsible for these activities. For that purpose, we synthesized the peptide, as 
      well as its structurally altered analog containing two D-amino acids. The peptides 
      were then biophysically and biologically investigated for their cytotoxicity and 
      immunomodulating activities. The data revealed that compared to the wild-type, the 
      diastereomer: (1) is significantly less toxic towards mammalian cells, in agreement 
      with its lower α-helical structure, as determined by circular dichroism 
      spectroscopy; (2) is more effective against the biofilm form of Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa (responsible for lung infections in cystic fibrosis sufferers), while 
      maintaining a high activity against the free-living form of this important pathogen; 
      (3) is more stable in serum; (4) has a higher activity in promoting migration of 
      lung epithelial cells, and presumably in healing damaged lung tissue, and (5) 
      disaggregates and detoxifies the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), albeit less 
      than the wild-type. Light scattering studies revealed a correlation between anti-LPS 
      activity and the ability to disaggregate the LPS. Besides shedding light on the 
      multifunction properties of esculentin-1a(1-21)NH2, the D-amino acid containing 
      isomer may serve as an attractive template for the development of new 
      anti-Pseudomonal compounds with additional beneficial properties. Furthermore, 
      together with other studies, incorporation of D-amino acids may serve as a general 
      approach to optimize the future design of new AMPs.

TI  - Maculatin 1.1, an anti-microbial peptide from the Australian tree frog, Litoria 
      genimaculata solution structure and biological activity.
PG  - 1894-908
AB  - The dorsal glands of Australian tree frogs from the Litoria species contain a 
      diversity of antibiotic peptides that forms part of the defence system of the 
      animal. Here, the antibiotic activity and structure of maculatin 1.1, a 21 amino 
      acid peptide from Litoria genimaculata, are compared. The activity data on maculatin 
      1.1 and a series of its analogues imply that the mechanism of action of maculatin 
      1.1 involves binding to, and subsequent lysis of, the bacterial cell membrane. The 
      structure of maculatin 1.1 was determined using NMR spectroscopy in a 
      trifluoroethanol/water mixture and when incorporated into dodecylphosphocholine 
      micelles. Under both conditions, the peptide adopts a very similar conformation, 
      i.e. a helical structure with a central kink in the vicinity of Pro15. The kink 
      allows the peptide to adopt a well-defined amphipathic conformation along its entire 
      length. The similar structures determined under both solvent conditions imply that 
      structures of membrane-interacting peptides in trifluoroethanol/water mixtures are 
      representative of those adopted in a membrane environment, e.g. when incorporated 
      into micelles. The synthetic Ala15 analogue of maculatin 1.1 has markedly reduced 
      activity and its NMR-derived structure is a well-defined helix, which lacks the 
      central kink and flexibility of the parent molecule. It is concluded that the kink 
      is important for full biological activity of the peptide, probably because it allows 
      maximum amphipathicity of the peptide to facilitate interaction with the membrane. 
      The structure of maculatin 1.1 is compared with a related peptide, caerin 1.1 [Wong, 
      H., Bowie, J.H. and Carver, J.A. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 247, 545-557], which has an 
      additional central proline residue and enhanced central flexibility compared with 
      maculatin 1.1. The role of central flexibility within antibiotic peptides in their 
      interaction with bacterial membranes is discussed.

TI  - The structural organization of aurein precursor cDNAs from the skin secretion of the 
      Australian green and golden bell frog, Litoria aurea.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Aureins are a family of peptides (13-25 residues), some of which possess potent 
      antimicrobial and anti-cancer properties, which have been classified into 5 
      subgroups based upon primary structural similarities. They were originally isolated 
      from the defensive skin secretions of the closely related Australian bell frogs, 
      Litoria aurea and Litoria raniformis, and of the 23 aurein peptides identified, 10 
      are common to both species. Using a recently developed technique, we have 
      constructed a cDNA library from the defensive secretion of the green and golden bell 
      frog, L. aurea, and successfully cloned a range of aurein precursor transcripts 
      containing entire open-reading frames. All open-reading frames consisted of a 
      putative signal peptide and an acidic pro-region followed by a single copy of 
      aurein. The deduced precursor structures for the most active aureins (2.2 and 3.1) 
      confirmed the presence of a C-terminal amidation motif whereas that of aurein 5.3 
      did not. Processed peptides corresponding in molecular mass to aureins 2.2, 2.3, 
      2.5, 3.1 and 5.3 were identified in the same secretion sample using LC/MS. The 
      application of this technique thus permits parallel peptidomic and transcriptomic 
      analyses on the same lyophilized skin secretion sample circumventing sacrifice of 
      specimens of endangered herpetofauna.

TI  - Developmental and triiodothyronine-induced expression of genes encoding 
      preprotemporins in the skin of Tago's brown frog Rana tagoi.
PG  - 242-50
AB  - Using RT-PCR, two cDNAs encoding preprotemporins were cloned from a total RNA 
      preparation of the skin of Tago's brown frog Rana tagoi. Preprotemporin-1TGa cDNA 
      directs the synthesis of temporin-1TGa (FLPILGKLLSGIL.NH2) previously isolated from 
      R. tagoi skin. Preprotemporin-1TGb cDNA directs the synthesis of a novel 
      16-amino-acid-residue peptide (AVDLAKIANKVLSSLF.NH2) that, atypically for members of 
      the temporin family, inhibits the growth of Gram-negative bacteria more effectively 
      than Gram-positive bacteria. Preprotemporin-1TGa mRNA and preprotemporin-1TGb mRNA 
      were not detected in skin prior to the onset of metamorphosis (stage 35) but the 
      levels of the transcripts increased markedly during metamorphosis reaching a maximum 
      at stage 38. Exposure of adult animals to 10(-8) M triiodothyronine (T3) for 72 h 
      enhanced expression of the preprotemporin-1TGb gene (approximately threefold) but 
      did not significantly change the level of expression of the preprotemporin-1TGa 
      gene. Exposure of the animals to 10(-8) M T3 and 10(-6) M bisphenol A, an endocrine 
      disrupting chemical that potently inhibits the action of thyroid hormones (THs), 
      reduced expression of the preprotemporin-1TGb gene by 10-fold and the 
      preprotemporin-1TGa gene by threefold. We propose that T3-stimulated synthesis of 
      antimicrobial peptides is important in protecting the animal against microorganisms, 
      particularly at metamorphosis and during skin moulting, but environmental pollutants 
      can inhibit peptide synthesis and render the animal susceptible to invasion by 
      pathogens.

AB  - This work is an attempt to take advantage of the rich biodiversity that exists in 
      Colombia in order to start a systematic analysis of antimicrobial substances that 
      have emerged through amphibian evolution. For this purpose we have developed a 
      technique to grow intact frog skin derived micro-organs (SMOs) in vitro in the 
      absence of serum. We show that in SMOs, the skin glands remain intact and continue 
      to secrete into the medium substances with potent antibacterial activity, for 
      several days in culture. Our strategy has been to create a bank of substances 
      secreted by amphibian skin from different species. This bank contains at present 
      around 50 species and is of particular importance as some of the species are in 
      danger of disappearing. We show that some of the species tested displayed very 
      strong antibacterial activity without being toxic to somatic cell lines, even at 
      10-fold higher concentration.

TI  - Identification and bioactivity evaluation of two novel temporins from the skin 
      secretion of the European edible frog, Pelophylax kl. esculentus.

AB  - The amphibian temporins, amongst the smallest antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are 
      α-helical, amphipathic, hydrophobic and cationic and are active mainly against 
      Gram-positive bacteria but inactive or weakly active against Gram-negative bacteria. 
      Here, we report two novel members of the temporin family, named temporin-1Ee 
      (FLPVIAGVLSKLFamide) and temporin-1Re (FLPGLLAGLLamide), whose biosynthetic 
      precursor structures were deduced from clones obtained from skin secretion-derived 
      cDNA libraries of the European edible frog, Pelophylax kl. esculentus, by 'shotgun' 
      cloning. Deduction of the molecular masses of each mature processed peptide from 
      respective cloned cDNAs was used to locate respective molecules in reverse-phase 
      HPLC fractions of secretion. Temporin-1Ee (MIC = 10 μM) and temporin-1Re 
      (MIC = 60 μM) were both found to be active against Gram-positive Staphylococcus 
      aureus, but retaining a weak haemolytic activity. To our knowledge, Single-site 
      substitutions can dramatically change the spectrum of activity of a given temporin. 
      Compared with temporine-1Ec, just one chemically-conservative substitution (Val8 
      instead of Leu8), temporin-1Ee bearing a net charge of +2 displays broad-spectrum 
      activity with particularly high potency on the clinically relevant Gram-negative 
      strains, Escherichia coli (MIC = 40 μM). These factors bode well for translating 
      temporins to be potential drug candidates for the design of new and valuable 
      anti-infective agents.

TI  - Inactivation of frog virus 3 and channel catfish virus by esculentin-2P and 
      ranatuerin-2P, two antimicrobial peptides isolated from frog skin.
PG  - 351-7
AB  - While it is clear that some amphibian populations have recently experienced 
      precipitous declines, the causes of those die-offs are complex and likely involve 
      multiple variables. One theory suggests that environmental factors may trigger 
      events that result in depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to 
      infectious disease. Here we examine one aspect of innate immunity in amphibians and 
      show that esculentin-2P (E2P) and ranatuerin-2P (R2P), two antimicrobial peptides 
      isolated from Rana pipiens, inactivate frog virus 3, a potentially pathogenic 
      iridovirus infecting anurans, and channel catfish herpesvirus. In contrast to 
      mammalian antimicrobial peptides, E2P and R2P act within minutes, at temperatures as 
      low as 0 degrees C, to inhibit viral infectivity. Moreover, these compounds appear 
      to inactivate the virus directly and do not act by inhibiting replication in 
      infected cells. This is the first report linking amphibian antimicrobial peptides 
      with protection from an amphibian viral pathogen and suggests that these compounds 
      may play a role in maintaining amphibian health.

TI  - Larval exposure to predator cues alters immune function and response to a fungal 
      pathogen in post-metamorphic wood frogs.
PG  - 1443-54
AB  - For the past several decades, amphibian populations have been decreasing around the 
      globe at an unprecedented rate. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the fungal 
      pathogen that causes chytridiomycosis in amphibians, is contributing to amphibian 
      declines. Natural and anthropogenic environmental factors are hypothesized to 
      contribute to these declines by reducing the immunocompetence of amphibian hosts, 
      making them more susceptible to infection. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced in 
      the granular glands of a frog's skin are thought to be a key defense against Bd 
      infection. These peptides may be a critical immune defense during metamorphosis 
      because many acquired immune functions are suppressed during this time. To test if 
      stressors alter AMP production and survival of frogs exposed to Bd, we exposed wood 
      frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles to the presence or absence of dragonfly 
      predator cues crossed with a single exposure to three nominal concentrations of the 
      insecticide malathion (0, 10, or 100 parts per billion [ppb]). We then exposed a 
      subset of post-metamorphic frogs to the presence or absence of Bd zoospores and 
      measured frog survival. Although predator cues and malathion had no effect on 
      survival or size at metamorphosis, predator cues increased the time to metamorphosis 
      by 1.5 days and caused a trend of a 20% decrease in hydrophobic skin peptides. 
      Despite this decrease in peptides determined shortly after metamorphosis, previous 
      exposure to predator cues increased survival in both Bd-exposed and unexposed frogs 
      several weeks after metamorphosis. These results suggest that exposing tadpoles to 
      predator cues confers fitness benefits later in life.

TI  - The role of defensins in the excitability of the peripheral vestibular system in the 
      frog: evidence for the presence of communication between the immune and nervous 
      systems.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Defensins are one of the major groups of endogenous peptides that are considered to 
      be important antibiotic-like effectors of host innate and adaptive antimicrobial 
      immunity. The current study investigated the electrophysiological effects of 
      externally applied human and rabbit defensins (HNP-1 and RNP-1, correspondingly) on 
      afferent neurotransmission in the frog semicircular canals (SCC). Application of 
      HNP-1 and RNP-1 induces a concentration-dependent decrease in resting activity. 
      Threshold concentrations for both substances were of the order of 0.0001 nM. The 
      firing evoked by L-glutamate (L-Glu) and its agonists 
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), kainate and 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and (1S, 3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxilic 
      acid (ACPD) could be inhibited by HNP-1, suggesting that defensins exert inhibitory 
      control over both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. HNP-1 
      considerably inhibited the L-glutamate/high Mg2+ -induced increase in frequency, 
      thus, demonstrating its postsynaptic site of action. Acetylcholine (ACh) responses 
      under HNP-1 did not differ from the frequency increase induced by ACh alone, and the 
      ACh antagonist atropine left the response to HNP-1 intact. The specific opioid 
      receptor antagonist naloxone (Nal) antagonized the inhibitory response evoked by 
      HNP-1. The results obtained support the evidence for the recruitment of defensins in 
      communication between the immune and nervous systems, and on the potential of 
      sensory receptors to participate in the inflammatory response.

AB  - The host-defense peptide, esculentin-2CHa (GFSSIFRGVA(10)KFASKGLGK 
      D(20)LAKLGVDLVA(30) CKISKQC) shows potent (MIC≤6 μM) growth inhibitory activity 
      against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and differential cytotoxic 
      activity against human erythrocytes (LC(50)=150 μM) and human non-small cell lung 
      adenocarcinoma A549 cells (LC(50)=10 μM). Esculentin-2CHa significantly (P<0.01) 
      stimulates the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by mouse lymphoid 
      cells and elevates its production after stimulation with concanavalin A and 
      significantly (P<0.05) stimulates TNF-α production by peritoneal macrophages. 
      Effects on IL-6 and IL-1β production were not significant. Removal of the 
      hydrophobic N-terminal hexapeptide (GFSSIF) from esculentin-2CHa results in 
      abolition of growth inhibitory activity against S. aureus and cytotoxic activity 
      against erythrocytes and A549 cells as well as a marked (≥16-fold) reduction in 
      potency against A. baumannii and S. maltophilia. The primary structure of 
      esculentin-2 has been poorly conserved between frog species but evolutionary 
      pressure has acted to maintain the hydrophobic character of this N-terminal 
      hexapeptide sequence. Removal of the cyclic C-terminal domain (CKISKQC) and 
      replacement of the Cys(31) and Cys(37) residues by serine resulted in appreciable 
      decreases in cytotoxicity against all microorganisms and against mammalian cells. 
      The more cationic [D20K, D27K] analog showed a modest increase in potency against 
      all microorganisms (up to 4-fold) but a marked increase in cytotoxicity against 
      erythrocytes (LC(50)=11 μM) and A549 cells (LC(50)=3 μM).

AB  - Lactococcus lactis CRL 1584 isolated from a Lithobates catesbeianus hatchery 
      inhibits the growth of Citrobacter freundii (a bullfrog pathogen) and Listeria 
      monocytogenes by a synergistic effect between lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and a 
      bacteriocin-like molecule. The chemical characterization of the bacteriocin in 
      cell-free supernatants indicates that it has a proteinaceous nature. Hexadecane and 
      ethyl acetate did not modify the bacteriocin activity, while 10 and 20 % (v/v) 
      chloroform decreased the activity by 29 and 43 %, respectively. The antimicrobial 
      peptide was heat stable since 85 % of residual activity was detected when 
      neutralized supernatants were heated at 80 °C for 30 min. Moreover, no bacteriocin 
      inactivation was observed when supernatants were kept at -20 °C for 3 months. The 
      synthesis of the bacteriocin was associated with bacterial growth, highest 
      production (2,100 AU/ml) being detected at the end of the exponential growth phase. 
      At pH ranges of 5-6.5 and 5.0-5.5 the inhibitory molecule was stable when stored for 
      2 days at 4 and 25 °C, respectively. Moreover, it had a bactericidal effect on L. 
      monocytogenes and the ultrastructural studies of pathogenic cells revealed clumping 
      of the cytoplasmic material, increased periplasmic space and cell wall 
      modifications. The deduced amino acid sequence of the bacteriocin was identical to 
      nisin Z and the genetic determinants for its production are harbored in the 
      chromosome. These results, described for the first time in L. lactis from a bullfrog 
      hatchery, will increase knowledge of the bacteriocin under study with a view to its 
      potential inclusion in probiotics for raniculture or biopreservatives.

LID - 10.1021/ac501200h [doi]
AB  - An efficient approach to easy and reliable differentiation between isomeric leucine 
      and isoleucine in peptide sequencing utilizes multistage electron transfer 
      dissociation and higher energy collision activated dissociation in the Orbitrap 
      Fusion mass spectrometer. The MS(3) method involves production and isolation of 
      primary odd-electron z(•) ions, followed by radical site initiation of their 
      fragmentation with formation of w-ions, characteristic of the isomeric amino acid 
      residues. Six natural nontryptic peptides isolated from the secretion of frog Rana 
      ridibunda were studied. Their lengths were in the range between 15 and 37 amino 
      acids and the number of targeted isomeric (Leu/Ile) residues varied between 1 and 7. 
      The experiments were successful in all 22 cases of Leu/Ile residues, leaving no 
      doubts in identification. The method is extremely selective as the targeted w-ions 
      appear to be the most intense in the spectra. The proposed approach may be 
      incorporated into shotgun proteomics algorithms and allows for the development of an 
      exclusively mass spectrometric method for automated complete de novo sequencing of 
      various peptides and proteins.

TI  - Vespid chemotactic peptide precursor from the wasp, Vespa magnifica (Smith).
PG  - 377-82
AB  - Despite the evolutional distance between wasp and amphibian, vespid chemotactic 
      peptide (VCP), an important component of wasp venom, are found sharing remarkable 
      similarities with the temporin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from Ranid frog, 
      Amolops loloensis. Not only their amino acid sequences are highly similar, but they 
      are both microbe-killing and can induce the cellular chemotactic response. However, 
      whether the two peptides possess identical biosynthesis pathway was still not clear 
      due to the unsolved gene sequence of VCP putative precursor. In this paper, a cDNA 
      encoding one of VCP precursors was cloned from the venom sac cDNA library of the 
      wasp, Vespa magnifica (Smith), and the corresponding native VCP was purified from 
      the venoms. It was shown that the VCP precursor highly resembled temporin precursor 
      not only in the sequence size but also in the sequences of their corresponding 
      mature peptides. However, the enzyme-cutting sites and the possible processing 
      enzymes for both peptides were different, which for VCP were dipeptidyl peptidase IV 
      and trypsin-like proteases, while for temporin were only trypsin-like protease. The 
      current results suggested that the biosynthesis mode of VCP was different from that 
      of temporin AMP, even though the two mature peptides were similar in many ways. It 
      is also the first report about VCP precursor from wasp venom.

TI  - Immune defenses against Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a fungus linked to global 
      amphibian declines, in the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis.
PG  - 3981-92
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00402-10 [doi]
AB  - Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a chytrid fungus that causes the lethal skin 
      disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. It is regarded as an emerging infectious 
      disease affecting diverse amphibian populations in many parts of the world. Because 
      there are few model amphibian species for immunological studies, little is known 
      about immune defenses against B. dendrobatidis. We show here that the South African 
      clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is a suitable model for investigating immunity to this 
      pathogen. After an experimental exposure, a mild infection developed over 20 to 30 
      days and declined by 45 days postexposure. Either purified antimicrobial peptides or 
      mixtures of peptides in the skin mucus inhibited B. dendrobatidis growth in vitro. 
      Skin peptide secretion was maximally induced by injection of norepinephrine, and 
      this treatment resulted in sustained skin peptide depletion and increased 
      susceptibility to infection. Sublethal X-irradiation of frogs decreased leukocyte 
      numbers in the spleen and resulted in greater susceptibility to infection. 
      Immunization against B. dendrobatidis induced elevated pathogen-specific IgM and IgY 
      serum antibodies. Mucus secretions from X. laevis previously exposed to B. 
      dendrobatidis contained significant amounts of IgM, IgY, and IgX antibodies that 
      bind to B. dendrobatidis. These data strongly suggest that both innate and adaptive 
      immune defenses are involved in the resistance of X. laevis to lethal B. 
      dendrobatidis infections.

TI  - Isolation of peptides of the brevinin-1 family with potent candidacidal activity 
      from the skin secretions of the frog Rana boylii.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - The emergence of strains of the human pathogen Candida albicans with resistance to 
      commonly used antibiotics has necessitated a search for new types of antifungal 
      agents. Six peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from the foothill yellow-legged frog Rana 
      boylii. Brevinin-1BYa (FLPILASLAA10KFGPKLF CLV20TKKC) was particularly potent 
      against C. albicans [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 3 microm] and also 
      active against Escherichia coli (MIC = 17 microm) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 2 
      microm), but its therapeutic potential for systemic use is limited by its strong 
      hemolytic activity (HC50 = 4 microm). The single amino acid substitution (Phe12 --> 
      Leu) in brevinin-1BYb resulted in a fourfold lower potency against C. albicans and 
      the additional amino acid substitutions (Lys11 --> Thr, Phe17 --> Leu and Val20 --> 
      Ile) in brevinin-1BYc resulted in a ninefold decrease in activity. Two members of 
      the ranatuerin-2 family and one member of the temporin family were also isolated 
      from the secretions but showed relatively low potency against the three 
      microorganisms tested.

TI  - Disulfide-containing peptides from the glandular skin secretions of froglets of the 
      genus Crinia: structure, activity and evolutionary trends.
PG  - 80-7
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2008.06.004 [doi]
AB  - The skin secretions of Crinia signifera, C. riparia and C. deserticola contain 
      bioactive disulfide-containing peptides. Signiferin 1 (RLCIPYIIPC-OH) from C. 
      signifera and C. deserticola) contracts smooth muscle at a concentration of 10(-9) 
      M, and effects proliferation of lymphocytes at 10(-6) M. In contrast, riparin 1.1 
      (RLCIPVIFC-OH) and riparin 1.2 (FLPPCAYKGTC-OH) from C. riparia show lymphocyte 
      activity but do not contract smooth muscle. The lymphocyte and smooth muscle 
      activities involve CCK2R. 3D structures of signiferin 1 and riparin 1.1 have been 
      established using 2D NMR methods: these studies show significant differences in the 
      shapes of the disulfide rings and with the orientations of the N-terminal residues. 
      cDNA cloning establishes that the pre sections of the precursor pre-pro-riparin 
      1.4-1.6 peptides are different from the conserved pre regions of 
      disulfide-containing antimicrobial peptides from species of the genus Rana found in 
      the northern hemisphere and caerin antimicrobial peptides isolated from Australian 
      tree frogs of the genus Litoria. This suggests that (i) either that riparins 1 have 
      converged to similar structure and function to the ranid and hyloid prepropeptides 
      which were lost initially from the myobatrachid lineage, or (ii) the prepropeptides 
      in all three groups were derived from a single ancestral form that has remained 
      relatively conserved in the hyloid and ranoid lineages but has undergone substantial 
      divergent evolution in the myobatrachids.

TI  - Specific and selective peptide-membrane interactions revealed using quartz crystal 
      microbalance.
PG  - 3907-16
AB  - The skin secretions of Australian tree frogs are rich in peptides with potential 
      antimicrobial activity. They interrupt bacterial cell membranes, although precisely 
      how and whether all peptides have the same mechanism is not known. The interactions 
      of three of these peptides-aurein 1.2, maculatin 1.1, and caerin 1.1 with supported 
      phospholipid bilayers-are examined here using quartz crystal microbalance and atomic 
      force microscopy. These approaches enabled us to reveal variations in material 
      structure and density as a function of distance from the sensor surface when 
      comparing mass sensorgrams over a range of harmonics of the natural resonance of the 
      sensor crystal and hence obtain for the first time to our knowledge a mechanistic 
      assessment of membrane disruption. We found that caerin inserted into the bilayer in 
      a transmembrane manner, regardless of concentration and phospholipid composition 
      consistent with a pore-forming mechanism. In contrast, maculatin and aurein 
      interacted with membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations 
      (<5 microM), maculatin exhibited transmembrane incorporation whereas aurein was 
      limited to surface association. Upon reaching a threshold value of concentration, 
      both peptides lysed the membrane. In the case of maculatin, the lysis progressed in 
      a slow, concentration-dependent manner, forming mixed micelles, as shown by atomic 
      force microscopy imaging. Aurein-induced lysis proceeded to a sudden disruption, 
      which is consistent with the "carpet" mechanism. Both maculatin and aurein exhibit 
      specificity toward phospholipids and thus have potential as candidates as 
      antimicrobial drugs.

PG  - 494-6

AB  - Temporins are a group of small, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptides widely 
      distributed in the skin of frogs from the Ranidae family. In order to examine the 
      mechanisms of regulation of temporin gene expression, we measured expression levels 
      of preprotemporin mRNA in the skin of the Japanese mountain brown frog Rana 
      ornativentris, using a semiquantitative RT-PCR system. Preprotemporin mRNAs were not 
      detected in skin prior to the onset of metamorphosis but their levels increased 
      markedly during metamorphosis, reaching a maximum at the stages of metamorphic 
      climax, suggesting a correlation with thyroid hormone concentrations. Consequently, 
      we examined direct effects of triiodothyronine (T(3)) on in vivo preprotemporin gene 
      expression. Treatment of adult animals with 2 x 10(-9) mol/L T(3) for 48 h raised 
      the preprotemporin mRNA levels in skin by 1.5-fold compared with untreated controls.

TI  - Identification and molecular cloning of a novel amphibian Bowman Birk-type trypsin

PG  - 245-50
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2012.01.003 [doi]
AB  - In this study, an amphibian (Odorrana hejiangensis) skin extract was fractionated by 
      reverse phase HPLC and fractions were screened for trypsin inhibitory activity. 
      Using this initial approach, a novel trypsin inhibitory peptide was detected with an 
      apparent protonated molecular mass of 1804.83 Da, as determined by MALDI-TOF mass 
      spectrometry. It was named Hejiang trypsin inhibitor (HJTI) in accordance. The 
      primary structure of the biosynthetic precursor of HJTI was deduced from a cDNA 
      sequence cloned from a skin-derived cDNA library. The primary structure of the 
      encoded predicted mature active peptide was established as: GAPKGCWTKSYPPQPCS 
      (non-protonated monoisotopic molecular mass--1802.81Da). On the basis of this 
      unequivocal amino acid sequence, a synthetic replicate was synthesized by solid 
      phase Fmoc chemistry. This replicate displayed a moderately potent trypsin 
      inhibition with a K(i) of 388 nM. Bioinformatic analysis of the primary structure of 
      this peptide indicated that it was a member of the Bowman-Birk family of protease 
      inhibitors. The substitutions of Gln-14 and Ser-17 by Lys, resulted in an increase 
      in cationicity and a small increase in potency to a K(i) value of 218nM. Neither 
      HJTI nor its synthetic analog, possessed any significant antimicrobial activity.

      residues is: Thr (loss of MeCHO) > Ser (CH(2)O) > Glu (H(2)O) > Gln (NH(3)). When 
      one of more of these residues is (are) present, the alpha and beta' cleavages often 
      occur from a fragment rather than the [Mbond;H](-) anion, e.g. for Thr, the 
      [(Mbond;H)(-)bond;MeCHO](-) anion. These four residues also initiate gamma backbone 
      cleavage reactions. The relative abundances of peaks resulting from gamma cleavage 
      are Glu > Ser = Thr > Gln for maculatin 1 spectra. An unusual Gln19/Ile17 
      cyclisation/cleavage reaction occurs in maculatin spectra: the peptide [Mbond;H](-) 
      anion must adopt a helical conformation in order for these two groups to interact. 
      Analogous fragmentations have been reported previously in the negative ion spectra 
      of the caerin 1 peptides.

TI  - LTQ Orbitrap Velos in routine de novo sequencing of non-tryptic skin peptides from 
      the frog Rana latastei with traditional and reliable manual spectra interpretation.
PG  - 265-76
AB  - RATIONALE: Mass spectrometry has shown itself to be the most efficient tool for the 
      sequencing of peptides. However, de novo sequencing of novel natural peptides is 
      significantly more challenging in comparison with the same procedure applied for the 
      tryptic peptides. To reach the goal in this case it is essential to select the most 
      efficient methods of triggering fragmentation and combine all the possible 
      complementary techniques. METHODS: Collision-induced dissociation (CID), high-energy 
      collision dissociation (HCD), and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) tandem mass 
      spectra recorded with a LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument were used for the elucidation 
      of the sequence of the natural non-tryptic peptides from the skin secretion of Rana 
      latastei. Manual interpretation of the spectra was applied. RESULTS: The combined 
      approach using CID, HCD, and ETD tandem mass spectra of the multiprotonated peptides 
      in various charge states, as well as of their proteolytic fragments, allowed the 
      sequences of seven novel peptides from the skin secretion of Rana latastei to be 
      established. CONCLUSIONS: Manual mass spectrometry sequencing of natural non-tryptic 
      peptides from the skin secretion of Rana latastei provided the opportunity to work 
      successfully with these species and demonstrated once again its advantage over 
      automatic approaches.

TI  - Evaluation of amphotericin B and chloramphenicol as alternative drugs for treatment 
      of chytridiomycosis and their impacts on innate skin defenses.
PG  - 4034-41
LID - 10.1128/AEM.04171-13 [doi]
AB  - Chytridiomycosis, an amphibian skin disease caused by the emerging fungal pathogen 
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been implicated in catastrophic global amphibian 
      declines. The result is an alarming decrease in amphibian diversity that is a great 
      concern for the scientific community. Clinical trials testing potential antifungal 
      drugs are needed to identify alternative treatments for amphibians infected with 
      this pathogen. In this study, we quantified the MICs of chloramphenicol (800 μg/ml), 
      amphotericin B (0.8 to 1.6 μg/ml), and itraconazole (Sporanox) (20 ng/ml) against B. 
      dendrobatidis. Both chloramphenicol and amphotericin B significantly reduced B. 
      dendrobatidis infection in naturally infected southern leopard frogs (Rana 
      [Lithobates] sphenocephala), although neither drug was capable of complete fungal 
      clearance. Long-term exposure of R. sphenocephala to these drugs did not inhibit 
      antimicrobial peptide (AMP) synthesis, indicating that neither drug is detrimental 
      to this important innate skin defense. However, we observed that chloramphenicol, 
      but not amphotericin B or itraconazole, inhibited the growth of multiple R. 
      sphenocephala skin bacterial isolates in vitro at concentrations below the MIC 
      against B. dendrobatidis. These results indicate that treatment with chloramphenicol 
      might dramatically alter the protective natural skin microbiome when used as an 
      antifungal agent. This study represents the first examination of the effects of 
      alternative antifungal drug treatments on amphibian innate skin defenses, a crucial 
      step to validating these treatments for practical applications.

TI  - Cytolytic peptides belonging to the brevinin-1 and brevinin-2 families isolated from 
      the skin of the Japanese brown frog, Rana dybowskii.
PG  - 746-56
AB  - Peptidomic analysis of an extract of the skins of specimens of Dybowski's brown frog 
      Rana dybowskii Gunther, 1876, collected on Tsushima Island, Japan led to the 
      identification of 10 peptides with differential antibacterial and hemolytic 
      activities. The primary structures of these peptides identified them as belonging to 
      the brevinin-1 (5 peptides) and brevinin-2 (5 peptides) families of antimicrobial 
      peptides. A peptide (FIGPIISALASLFG.NH(2)) with structural similarity to members of 
      the temporin family was also isolated but this component lacked cytolytic activity. 
      Phylogenetic relationships among the Japanese brown frogs (R. dybowskii, R. 
      japonica, R. okinavana, R. ornativentris, R. pirica, R. sakuraii, R. tagoi, and R. 
      tsushimensis) are only incompletely understood. Cladograms based upon maximum 
      parsimony analyses of the brevinin-1 and brevinin-2 amino acid sequences provide 
      strong support for a sister-group relationship between R. dybowskii and R. pirica 
      and somewhat weaker support for a sister-group relationship between R. okinavana and 
      R. tsushimensis. These conclusions are consistent with previous analyses based upon 
      allozyme variations and comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial 
      genes.

AB  - The primary structures of host-defense peptides present in frog skin secretions 
      constitute useful molecular markers for establishing taxonomic classifications and 
      investigating phylogenetic relationships between species within a particular genus. 
      Peptidomic analysis has led to the characterization of multiple host-defense 
      peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of three species of frogs from 
      the family Ranidae: Lithobates forreri (Boulenger, 1883), Hylarana luctuosa (Peters, 
      1871), and Hylarana signata (Günther, 1872). The L. forreri secretions contain 
      ranatuerin-2 (2 peptides), brevinin-1 (4 peptides), and temporin (1 peptide). The H. 
      luctuosa secretions contain brevinin-2 (4 peptides), esculentin-1 (1 peptide), 
      esculentin-2 (1 peptide), palustrin-2 (2 peptides), and temporin (2 peptides). The 
      H. signata secretions contain brevinin-2 (4 peptides), brevinin-1 (5 peptides), 
      palustrin-2 (1 peptide), and temporin (2 peptides). Cladistic analysis based upon 
      the primary structures of 44 ranatuerin-2 peptides from 20 Lithobates species 
      indicates a close phylogenetic relationship between L. forreri, Lithobates onca, and 
      Lithobates yavapaiensis. A similar cladistic analysis based upon the primary 
      structures of 27 brevinin-2 peptides from 8 Hylarana species provides support for a 
      close phylogenetic relationship between H. signata and Hylarana picturata, while 
      showing that the species are not conspecific, with H. luctuosa more distantly 
      related.

PG  - 3063-74
AB  - [M--H]- parent anions of underivatised peptides containing an intramolecular 
      disulfide bridge undergo characteristic loss of the elements of H2S2, a process 
      diagnostic of the presence of the disulfide moeity. This facile process is initiated 
      from a side-chain enolate anion. Theoretical calculations (at the HF/6-31G(d)//AM1 
      level of theory) indicate that the process is exothermic with a small barrier. When 
      the disulfide link involves a C-terminal Cys, the negative ion spectrum shows an 
      [(M--H)--(H2S2+CO2)] fragment anion which is usually the main peak of the spectrum. 
      This process is also directed by an enolate anion: theoretical calculations suggest 
      a stepwise sequence with loss of CO2 preceding loss of H2S2. Both [(M--H)--H2S2] and 
      [(M--H)--(H2S2+CO2)] anions undergo backbone cleavage allowing identification of the 
      amino acid sequence of the peptide.

TI  - Skin peptides from anurans of the Litoria rubella Group: sequence determination 
      using electrospray mass spectrometry. Opioid activity of two major peptides.
PG  - 1189-95
LID - 10.1002/rcm.3988 [doi]
AB  - Many species of frogs of the genus Litoria secrete bioactive peptides from their 
      skin glands. These peptides are normally host-defence compounds and may have one, or 
      more of the following activities; smooth muscle contraction, analgesic, 
      antimicrobial, antiviral, lymphocyte proliferator (immunomodulator) and neuronal 
      nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inactivation. Two frog species of the Litoria rubella 
      Group that have been studied before, namely, Litoria electrica and Litoria rubella, 
      are different from other species of the genus Litoria in that they produce small 
      peptides that show neither membrane, lymphocyte nor nNOS activity. In this study we 
      have used electrospray mass spectrometry together with Edman sequencing to identify 
      eight skin peptides of the third member of this Group, Litoria dentata: 
      surprisingly, none of these peptides show activity in our biological screening 
      program. However, two major peptides (FPWL-NH(2) and FPWP-NH(2)) from L. electrica 
      and L. rubella are opioids at the micromolar concentration.

PG  - 1409-1418
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12937 [doi]
AB  - Two novel peptides (brevinin1 HYba1 and brevinin1 HYba2) were identified from the 
      skin secretion of the frog Hydrophylax bahuvistara, endemic to Western Ghats, India, 
      and their amino acid sequences were confirmed using cDNA cloning and LC/MS/MS. 
      Antibacterial, hemolytic, and cytotoxic activities of brevinin1 peptides and their 
      synthetic analogs (amidated C-terminus) were investigated and compared. All the 
      peptides except the acidic forms showed antibacterial activity against all tested 
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They exhibited low hemolysis on human 
      erythrocytes and showed potent cytotoxic activity against Hep 3B cancer cell line. 
      Upon amidation, the peptides showed increased activity against the tested microbes 
      without altering their hemolytic and cytotoxic properties. The study also emphasizes 
      the need for screening endemic amphibian fauna of Western Ghats, as a potential 
      source of host defense peptides with possible therapeutic applications in the 
      future.

TI  - Differential expression of genes encoding preprobrevinin-2, prepropalustrin-2, and

      Rana ornativentris.
PG  - 122-30

AB  - Previous studies led to the isolation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of the 
      brevinin-2, palustrin-2, and ranatuerin-2 families from skin extracts and/or skin 
      secretions of the Japanese mountain brown frog, Rana ornativentris. In the present 
      study, we cloned cDNAs encoding the precursors of brevinin-2Oc, palustrin-2Oa, and 
      ranatuerin-2Ob and -2Oe from skin total RNA preparations from adult R. ornativentris 
      and established a semi-quantitative RT-PCR system to measure the concentrations of 
      these mRNAs. The levels of preprobrevinin-2 and preproranatuerin-2 mRNAs in the skin 
      specimens of developing R. ornativentris larva were detectable only at stages later 
      than the onset of metamorphosis and reached peaks at the stage of metamorphic 
      climax. In contrast, prepropalustrin-2 mRNA was detected prior to the onset of 
      metamorphosis and levels peaked at stages earlier than those of the other two mRNAs. 
      In adult animals, preprobrevinin-2 and preproranatuerin-2 gene transcripts were 
      detected at low levels in the small intestine and skeletal muscle but not in the 
      stomach, liver, or kidney, whereas prepropalustrin-2 gene transcripts were detected 
      at relatively high concentrations in all tissues examined. These results indicate 
      that the expression of amphibian AMP genes is correlated with metamorphosis but is 
      subjected to differential regulation.

AB  - Five natural peptides isolated from ranid skin secretions of European frog species 
      of Rana ridibunda and Rana arvalis (molecular masses 3516, 2674, 2636, 1874, and 
      1810 Da) were studied by MALDI-TOF/TOF to compare two procedures of disulfide bond 
      cleavage: (1) performic oxidation and (2) reduction/carboxamidomethylation. The 
      processes are relevant for the elucidation of the amino acid sequence inside the 
      seven-member cystine ring at the C-terminus. The results clearly demonstrated that 
      oxidation of the disulfide bond led to notably higher abundances of b- and y-ions, 
      corresponding to the C-terminal peptide bonds, than 
      reduction/carboxamidomethylation. This conclusion is true for all five peptides 
      studied. Besides that, the oxidation procedure is simpler than 
      carboxamidomethylation, as it is a one-step process with no purification required. 
      The oxidation is more reproducible. The results were similar each time the peptide 
      was subjected to the process. It was successfully applied to all five peptides while 
      reduction/carboxamidomethylation failed in the case of brevinin-1Ra, despite all 
      variations of reaction conditions.

PG  - 241-6
AB  - Bioactive novel polypeptide of anuran skin has a wide range of antimicrobial 
      properties against the infection and tumour cell. Macrophages are known to produce 
      the Nitric oxide (NO) by a variety of cells upon activation. NO produced by the 
      activated macrophages an important mediator for antimicrobial and tumoricidal 
      activity. In-vitro macrophage exposed with medium alone, containing LPS, containing 
      polypepeptides and LPS plus polypeptides for 24 h showed enhanced production of NO 
      with respect to control and LPS treated and significant increase in NO production in 
      LPS plus polypeptide. Western blot and PCR analysis also showed that increased 
      production of protein expression and mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide 
      synthase (iNOS). These findings suggest that novel polypeptides are potent 
      activating agent for enhanced production of NO through activation of iNOS gene.

TI  - A synergism between temporins toward Gram-negative bacteria overcomes resistance 
      imposed by the lipopolysaccharide protective layer.
PG  - 28565-74
AB  - Temporins are short and homologous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) isolated from the 
      frog skin of Rana genus. To date, very little is known about the biological 
      significance of the presence of closely related AMPs in single living organisms. 
      Here we addressed this question using temporins A, B, and L isolated from Rana 
      temporaria. We found that temporins A and B are only weakly active toward 
      Gram-negative bacteria. However, a marked synergism occurs when each is mixed with 
      temporin L. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms involved in these activities, 
      we used various experimental strategies to investigate: (i) the effect of the 
      peptides' interaction on both the viability and membrane permeability of intact 
      bacteria and spheroplasts; (ii) their interaction with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and 
      the effect of LPS on the oligomeric state of temporins, alone or combining one with 
      another; (iii) their structure in solution and when bound to LPS, by using circular 
      dichroism and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies. Our data reveal that temporin L synergizes 
      with A and B by preventing their oligomerization in LPS. This should promote their 
      translocation across the outer membrane into the cytoplasmic membrane. To the best 
      of our knowledge, this is the first study that explains how a combination of native 
      AMPs from the same species can overcome bacterial resistance imposed by the LPS 
      leaflet.

AB  - The in-vitro activity of nisin, a 34-residue peptide produced by several Lactococcus 
      lactis strains, and ranalexin, a 20-residue peptide isolated from the skin of the 
      bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, alone and in combination with amoxycillin, 
      amoxycillin-clavulanate, imipenem, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin and 
      vancomycin was investigated against 40 nosocomial isolates of methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All isolates were inhibited at concentrations of 1 to 
      32 microg/ml. Synergy was observed when the peptides were combined with other 
      agents, with the exception of the beta-lactams. Finally, the consecutive exposures 
      to each peptide did not result in selection of stable mutants with decreased 
      susceptibility. Our finding show that nisin and ranalexin are active against MRSA, 
      and that their activity is enhanced when they are combined with several 
      antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Investigating the importance of the flexible hinge in caerin 1.1: solution 
      structures and activity of two synthetically modified caerin peptides.
PG  - 937-44
AB  - Caerin 1.1 is a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial peptide isolated from a number 
      of Australian frogs of the Litoria genus. In membrane-like media, this peptide 
      adopts two alpha-helices, separated by a flexible hinge region bounded by Pro15 and 
      Pro19. Previous studies have suggested that the hinge region is important for 
      effective orientation of the two helices within the bacterial cell membrane, 
      resulting in lysis via the carpet mechanism. To evaluate the importance of the two 
      Pro residues, they were replaced with either Ala or Gly. The antibacterial activity 
      of these two peptides was tested, and their three-dimensional structures were 
      determined using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics 
      calculations. The resulting structures indicate that the central hinge angle 
      decreases significantly upon replacement of the Pro residues with Gly and to a 
      further extent with Ala. This trend was mirrored by a corresponding decrease in 
      antibiotic activity, further exemplifying the necessity of the hinge in caerin 1.1 
      and related peptides. In a broader context, the use of Pro, Gly, and Ala variants of 
      caerin 1.1 has enabled the relationship between conformational flexibility and 
      activity to be directly investigated in a systematic manner.

      ESI-MS study of fragmentation efficiency.
PG  - 2246-55
LID - 10.1007/s13361-011-0247-0 [doi]
AB  - Mass spectrometry faces considerable difficulties in de novo sequencing of long 
      non-tryptic peptides with S-S bonds. Long disulfide-containing peptides brevinins 1E 
      and 2Ec from frog Rana ridibunda were reduced and alkylated with nine novel and 
      three known derivatizing agents. Eight of the novel reagents are maleimide 
      derivatives. Modified samples were subjected to MS/MS studies on FT-ICR and Orbitrap 
      mass spectrometers using CAD/HCD or ECD/ETD techniques. Procedures, fragmentation 
      patterns, and sequence coverage for two peptides modified with 12 tags are 
      described. ECD/ETD and CAD fragmentation revealed complementary sequence 
      information. Higher-energy collisionally activated dissociation (HCD) sufficiently 
      enhanced y-ions formation for brevinin 1E, but not for brevinin 2Ec. Some novel tags 
      [N-benzylmaleimide, N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)maleimide] along with known 
      N-phenylmaleimide and iodoacetic acid showed high total sequence coverage taking 
      into account combined ETD and HCD fragmentation. Moreover, modification of long (34 
      residues) brevinin 2Ec with N-benzylmaleimide or N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)maleimide 
      yielded high sequence coverage and full C-terminal sequence determination with ECD 
      alone.

AB  - The family Pipidae comprises the genera Hymenochirus, Pipa, Pseudhymenochirus, 
      Silurana, and Xenopus but phylogenetic relationships within the family are unclear. 
      Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from 
      Pseudhymenochirus merlini Chabanaud, 1920, the single species within the genus 
      Pseudhymenochirus, led to identification of 13 host-defense peptides with 
      antimicrobial activity. Two peptides (hymenochirin-1Pa and -1Pb) show structural 
      similarity to hymenochirin-1B from Hymenochirus boettgeri and eight peptides 
      (hymenochirin-5Pa, -5Pb, -5Pc, -5Pd, -5Pe, -5Pf, 5Pg and -5Ph) are structurally 
      similar to each other and to hymenochirin-5B from H. boettgeri. Two peptides 
      differing by a single amino acid (IKIPSFFRNILKKVGKEAVSLM/I AGALKQS), termed 
      pseudhymenochirin-1Pa and -1Pb, and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa 
      (GIFPIFAKLLGKVIKVASSLISKGRTE) do not resemble host-defense peptides previously 
      isolated from pipid frogs. Hymenochirin-5Pe was the most abundant peptide in the 
      secretions and hymenochirin-1Pa the most potent against Staphylococcus aureus 
      (MIC=2.5μM) and Escherichia coli (MIC=10μM). The data support a close phylogenetic 
      relationship between Hymenochirus and Pseudhymenochirus that is distinct from the 
      Xenopodinae (Xenopus+Silurana) clade with Pipa sister-group to all other extant 
      pipids.

TI  - Trypsin inhibitory loop is an excellent lead structure to design serine protease 
      inhibitors and antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 2466-73
AB  - The disulfide-bridged hendecapeptide (CWTKSIPPKPC) loop, derived from an amphibian 
      skin peptide, is found to have strong trypsin inhibitory capability. This loop, 
      called the trypsin inhibitory loop (TIL), appears to be the smallest serine protease 
      inhibitor known. A series of synthetic peptides derived from this loop also exhibits 
      trypsin inhibitory activity; some peptides even exhibit both antimicrobial and 
      trypsin inhibitory activities. Antimicrobial peptides are attractive candidates for 
      producing novel antibiotics, but their sensitivity to trypsin-like proteases 
      appreciably limits their application. Bifunctional peptides with both antimicrobial 
      and trypsin inhibitory activities could be ideal candidates for clinical 
      antibiotics, since these reported synthetic peptides have shown resistance against 
      trypsin. The crystal structure of a complex of trypsin with one TIL derivative is 
      solved. The concept of TIL is introduced in this paper. Novel trypsin inhibitors or 
      antimicrobial peptides can be designed readily on the basis of the TIL. Furthermore, 
      functional analysis and a precursor comparison suggest that serine protease 
      inhibitors may have a common ancestor with antimicrobial peptides.

      temporins have been characterized from North African frog species. We isolated three 
      novel members of the temporin family, named temporin-1Sa (FLSGIVGMLGKLF(amide)), 
      -1Sb (FLPIVTNLLSGLL(amide)), and -1Sc (FLSHIAGFLSNLF(amide)), from the skin of the 
      Sahara frog Pelophylax (Rana) saharica originating from Tunisia. These temporins 
      were identified by a combined mass spectrometry/molecular cloning approach. 
      Temporin-1Sa was found to be highly active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
      bacteria, yeasts and fungi (MIC=2-30 microM). To our knowledge, this is the first 
      13-residue member of the temporin family with a net charge of +2 that shows such 
      broad-spectrum activity with particularly high potency on the clinically relevant 
      Gram-negative strains, Escherichia coli (MIC=10 microM) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      (MIC=31 microM). Moreover, temporin-1Sa displays significant antiparasitic activity 
      (IC50 approximately 20 microM) against the promastigote and amastigote stages of 
      Leishmania infantum.

TI  - Host defense peptides in skin secretions of Odorrana tiannanensis: Proof for other 
      survival strategy of the frog than merely anti-microbial.
PG  - 649-55
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.09.017 [doi]
AB  - Genus Odorrana, among all amphibians studied, is generally reported to have the most 
      abundant and diversified anti-microbial peptides even from a single individual frog. 
      In our previous work, 46 cDNA sequences encoding precursors of 22 different 
      anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) were characterized from the skin of frog, Odorrana 
      tiannanensis. In this work, we reported the purification of three AMPs from skin 
      secretions of O. tiannanensis. Their amino acid sequences matched well with the 
      sequences deduced from cDNAs and they were designated as Odorranain-C7HSa, 
      Brevinin-1-OT2 and Odorranain-G-OT, respectively. Furthermore, we selected to 
      analyze the four most structurally diversified sequences among the 22 AMPs that are 
      significantly different from all reported AMPs. By structural characterization, 
      three of them were designated as pleurain-E-OT, odorranain-G-OT, odorranain-A-OT, 
      belonging to AMP families already identified. The forth one with a unique 14-mer 
      sequence of AILTTLANWARKFLa and C-terminal amidation represents the prototypes of a 
      new class of amphibian AMP, and thereby named tiannanensin. Such broad diversity in 
      sequences and structures are consistent with other species in Genus Odorrana. 
      Multi-functions of the synthesized four special AMPs were screened, including 
      anti-microbial, antioxidant, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities. The results suggest 
      that these AMPs may employ sophisticated mechanisms of action in host defense in 
      addition to anti-microbial, although their precise contribution to host defense 
      still seems unclear.

TI  - Phylloseptins: a novel class of anti-bacterial and anti-protozoan peptides from the 
      Phyllomedusa genus.
PG  - 565-73
AB  - Six novel peptides called phylloseptins (PS-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6) showing 
      anti-bacterial (PS-1) and anti-protozoan (PS-4 and -5) activities were isolated from 
      the skin secretion of the Brazilian tree-frogs, Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis and 
      Phyllomedusa oreades. Phylloseptins have a primary structure consisting of 19-21 
      amino acid residues (1.7-2.1 kDa). They have common structural features, such as a 
      highly conserved N-terminal region and C-terminal amidation. Phylloseptin-1 
      (FLSLIPHAINAVSAIAKHN-NH2) demonstrated a strong effect against gram-positive and 
      gram-negative bacteria (MICs ranging from 3 to 7.9 microM), without showing 
      significant hemolytic activity (<0.6% at the MIC range) towards mammalian cells. 
      Atomic force microscopy experiments indicated that the bacteriolytic properties of 
      these peptides might be related to their disruptive action on the cell membrane, 
      characterized by a number of bubble-like formations, preceding every cell lysis. 
      PS-4 and PS-5 showed anti-protozoan activity with IC50 at about 5 microM for 
      Trypanosoma cruzi.

TI  - Structure-function studies on the amphibian peptide brevinin 1E: translocating the 
      cationic segment from the C-terminal end to a central position favors selective 
      antibacterial activity.
PG  - 433-41
AB  - Brevinin 1E, which has the sequence FLPLLAGLAANFLPKIFCKITRKC, is an antimicrobial 
      peptide isolated from the skin secretions of the European frog Rana esculenta. Both 
      the linear and the disulfide-bridged forms have relatively broad-spectrum 
      antibacterial as well as hemolytic activities. The antibacterial and hemolytic 
      activities and biophysical properties of synthetic peptides corresponding to 
      brevinin 1E and its analog in which the segment CKITRKC has been transposed to a 
      central location resulting in the sequence FLPLLAGLCKITRKCAANFLPKIF have been 
      investigated. Our studies indicate that the analog peptide has antibacterial 
      activity comparable with brevinin 1E, but with considerably reduced hemolytic 
      activity. The linear variant of the analog has no hemolytic activity, unlike the 
      linear form of brevinin 1E. The biological activities can be explained on the basis 
      of relative affinities for anionic and zwitterionic lipids. A cluster of cationic 
      amino acids flanked on one side by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids and another 
      side composed of apolar amino acids appears to favor preferential antibacterial 
      activity.

TI  - Drosophila melanogaster is a genetically tractable model host for Mycobacterium 
      marinum.
PG  - 3540-50
AB  - Mycobacterium marinum is a pathogenic mycobacterial species that is closely related 
      to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and causes tuberculosis-like disease in fish and 
      frogs. We infected the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with M. marinum. This 
      bacterium caused a lethal infection in the fly, with a 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 5 
      CFU. Death was accompanied by widespread tissue damage. M. marinum initially 
      proliferated inside the phagocytes of the fly; later in infection, bacteria were 
      found both inside and outside host cells. Intracellular M. marinum blocked vacuolar 
      acidification and failed to colocalize with dead Escherichia coli, similar to 
      infections of mouse macrophages. M. marinum lacking the mag24 gene were less 
      virulent, as determined both by LD(50) and by death kinetics. Finally, in contrast 
      to all other bacteria examined, mycobacteria failed to elicit the production of 
      antimicrobial peptides in Drosophila.We believe that this system should be a useful 
      genetically tractable model for mycobacterial infection.

PG  - 79-87
LID - 10.3109/13625187.2013.769950 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned 
      pregnancies have serious effects on the reproductive health of women. The present 
      study was undertaken with a view to develop an effective means of prevention. The 
      microbicidal and contraceptive potential of cationic peptides from frog's skin, 
      namely, dermaseptin S4 and its derivatives were investigated in vitro.: STUDY DESIGN 
      Different bacterial and fungal strains were resorted to for determining the 
      antimicrobial activity of the new compounds. The spermicidal activities of the 
      latter were assessed using normal human semen samples, and their toxic effects were 
      identified in a HeLa culture. RESULTS: All S4 derivatives elicited 
      concentration-dependent spermicidal and antimicrobial activities at microgram 
      concentrations. The highest levels recorded for both types of activity were 
      displayed by K4K20S4, and the lowest levels were exhibited by D4D20S4 and S4(5-28). 
      Cytotoxicity assays revealed that some of these compounds were significantly safer 
      than nonoxynol-9 (N-9). CONCLUSIONS: The ability of these peptides to 
      instantaneously kill human sperm and STI pathogens at low concentrations indicates 
      that their application as active ingredients in vaginal contraceptive preparations 
      could induce considerably better effects than N-9.

TI  - Dermatoxin and phylloxin from the waxy monkey frog, Phyllomedusa sauvagei: cloning 
      of precursor cDNAs and structural characterization from lyophilized skin secretion.
PG  - 103-8
AB  - Amphibian skin is a morphologically, biochemically and physiologically complex organ 
      that performs the wide range of functions necessary for amphibian survival. Here we 
      describe the primary structures of representatives of two novel classes of amphibian 
      skin antimicrobials, dermatoxin and phylloxin, from the skin secretion of 
      Phyllomedusa sauvagei, deduced from their respective precursor encoding cDNAs cloned 
      from a lyophilized skin secretion library. A degenerate primer, designed to a highly 
      conserved domain in the 5'-untranslated region of analogous peptide precursor cDNAs 
      from Phyllomedusa bicolor, was employed in a 3'-RACE reaction. Peptides with 
      molecular masses coincident with precursor-deduced mature toxin peptides were 
      identified in LC/MS fractions of skin secretion and primary structures were 
      confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation. This integrated experimental approach can thus 
      rapidly expedite the primary structural characterization of amphibian skin peptides 
      in a manner that circumvents specimen sacrifice whilst preserving robustness of 
      scientific data.

TI  - A novel cationic ribonuclease with antimicrobial activity from Rana dybowskii.
PG  - 369-84
LID - 10.1007/s10528-010-9414-4 [doi]
AB  - A novel ribonuclease (RNase) A superfamily gene (Rdronc) has been cloned from the 
      frog Rana dybowskii. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that it belongs to the 
      ribonuclease A superfamily, with the highest identity, 73%, to Rana pipiens 
      onconase. Adaptive evolution analysis based on maximum likelihood models of codon 
      substitution has been conducted on 10 members of the Rana RNases of subcluster B. 
      Rapid adaptive evolution and multiple positive selection sites have been detected, 
      which indicates that these genes may be evolving under positive selection pressure. 
      Functional assay demonstrates that the recombinant Rdronc protein possesses 
      antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa and weaker antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus 
      aureus and yeast Candida albicans. Our findings support the hypothesis that 
      ribonuclease A superfamily members may function in host defense of early-diversified 
      vertebrates.

TI  - Antibacterial and hemolytic activity of the skin of the terrestrial salamander, 
      Plethodon cinereus.
PG  - 340-5
AB  - As resistance increases against fungal antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides are 
      receiving attention as possible replacements. The dermal glands of frogs secrete, 
      among other things, antimicrobial peptides. As part of the innate immune system, 
      stressors may affect the production of antimicrobial peptides by dermal glands. The 
      dermal secretions of some salamanders have been examined for their toxic secretions, 
      but little attention has been given to salamander antimicrobial peptides. This study 
      examines the skin from the tail region for the production of antimicrobial peptides 
      in the terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus. Fractions of tail extracts were 
      isolated using cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. An HPLC 
      fraction eluting at 15.75 min (HPLC run: 30 min, 30-80% acetonitrile/water gradient, 
      Aquapore RP-300 C18 column) showed activity against Staphylococcus aureus but not 
      against Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity gradually increased over a 4-hr 
      incubation time up to about 85% inhibition of bacterial growth. Lysis of guinea pig 
      red blood cells also increased gradually over a 1-hr time period. J. Exp. Zool.

      frog vestibular apparatus].
PG  - 705-10
AB  - The effect of human and rabbit neutrophilic defensins NP-1 and amonoglycoside 
      antibiotic gentamicin on the synaptic transmission in the afferent synapse of 
      isolated vestibular apparatus of the frog has been comparatively studied. Both 
      defensins proved active in the concentration range of 0.0001 to 1 nM and efficiently 
      decreased the impulse frequency in the afferent nerve fibers in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. No significant differences in the efficiency of 
      rabbit and human defensin NP-1 have been revealed in these experiments. Gentamicin 
      also had an inhibitory effect on the afferent discharge in the concentration range 
      of 10-500 microM (0.5-25 mg/kg). The inhibitory effect of gentamicin on the impulse 
      activity of the vestibular nerve was observed at therapeutic doses. The excitatory 
      effect of the putative neurotransmitter L-glutamate was considerably inhibited by 
      defensin NP-1. These findings suggest that the mechanism of defensin action involves 
      a modification of the synaptic transmission the hair receptor and is mediated by 
      L-glutamate.

TI  - Tigerinins: novel antimicrobial peptides from the Indian frog Rana tigerina.
PG  - 2701-7
AB  - Four broad-spectrum, 11 and 12 residue, novel antimicrobial peptides have been 
      isolated from the adrenaline-stimulated skin secretions of the Indian frog Rana 
      tigerina. Sequences of these peptides have been determined by automated Edman 
      degradation, by mass spectral analysis and confirmed by chemical synthesis. These 
      peptides, which we have named as tigerinins, are characterized by an intramolecular 
      disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues forming a nonapeptide ring. This 
      feature is not found in other amphibian peptides. Conformational analysis indicate 
      that the peptides tend to form beta-turn structures. The peptides are cationic and 
      exert their activity by permeabilizing bacterial membranes. Tigerinins represent the 
      smallest, nonhelical, cationic antimicrobial peptides from amphibians.

TI  - The rothein peptides from the skin secretion of Roth's tree frog Litoria rothii. 
      Sequence determination using positive and negative ion electrospray mass 
      spectrometry.
PG  - 2716-24
AB  - The secretion from the dorsal glands of the frog Litoria rothii contains a series of 
      new peptides including rothein 1 (SVSNIPESIGF-OH, a neuropeptide which contracts 
      smooth muscle), a number of inactive rothein 2 and 3 peptides (e.g. rothein 2.1, 
      AGGLDDLLEPVLNSADNLVHGL-OH), and a new proline rich peptide, named rothein 4.1 
      (AEILFGDVRPPWMPPPIFPEMP-OH), which shows neither antimicrobial nor neuronal nitric 
      oxide synthase (nNOS) activity. Two known neuropeptides of the caerulein family 
      [e.g. caerulein, pEQDY(SO3)TGWMDF-NH2] together with a series of known caerin 1 
      antibiotic and nNOS-inhibiting peptides (e.g. caerin 1.1, 
      GLLSVLGSVAKHVLPHVVPVIAEHL-NH2) were also identified. Positive ion electrospray mass 
      spectrometry (ES-MS) was used as the primary method to investigate the sequences of 
      the new peptides. Negative ion ES-MS was used to fill in any gaps in the positive 
      ion data and, finally, Edman automated sequencing was used to differentiate between 
      Leu and Ile and to confirm the sequences determined by mass spectrometry.

AB  - Long disulphide-containing peptides brevinins 1E and 2Ec from the skin secretion of 
      the frog Rana ridibunda were reduced and alkylated with ten novel and three known 
      derivatizing agents. Nine of novel reagents are maleimide derivatives. The peptides 
      were also reduced with DTT directly onto the MALDI target without alkylation. 
      Modified samples were subjected to MALDI-PSD study. Procedures, fragmentation 
      patterns, fragment ion signal abundances and sequence coverage for two peptides 
      modified with thirteen tags (or on-plate reduced) are described. The fast on-plate 
      procedure for reduction/alkylation was applied to Rana ridibunda crude secretion, 
      providing intensive signals of derivatized peptides. The corresponding ions may be 
      used for the MS/MS sequencing procedure.

AB  - Anionic antimicrobial peptides (AAMPs) with net charges ranging from -1 to -8 have 
      been identified in frogs, toads, newts and salamanders across Africa, South America 
      and China. Most of these peptides show antibacterial activity and a number of them 
      are multifunctional, variously showing antifungal activity, anticancer action, 
      neuropeptide function and the ability to potentiate conventional antibiotics. 
      Antimicrobial mechanisms proposed for these AAMPs, include toroidal pore formation 
      and the Shai-Huang-Matsazuki model of membrane interaction along with pH dependent 
      amyloidogenesis and membranolysis via tilted peptide formation. The potential for 
      therapeutic and biotechnical application of these AAMPs has been demonstrated, 
      including the development of amyloid-based nanomaterials and antiviral agents. It is 
      concluded that amphibian AAMPs represent an untapped potential source of 
      biologically active agents and merit far greater research interest.

TI  - A Novel Insulinotropic Peptide from the Skin Secretions of Amolops loloensis Frog.
PG  - 309-13
LID - 10.1007/s13659-014-0037-z [doi]
AB  - Various kinds of biologically active peptides have previously been isolated from the 
      skin secretions of Amolops loloensis frog, such as antimicrobial peptides, 
      bradykinin-like peptides and algesic peptides. A novel insulinotropic peptide named 
      amolopin was identified in A. loloensis frog's skin secretion. Its primary structure 
      sequence was determined by Edman degradation as: FLPIVGKSLSGLSGKL-NH2. BLAST search 
      indicates that the amino acid sequence of amolopin is quite different from other 
      known insulin secretagogues, including mastoparan, exendins and α-latrotoxin, nor 
      does it like incretins (e.g. glucagons like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent 
      insulinotropic ploypeptide) either. However, amolopin shows certain structural 
      similarity with amphibian antimicrobial temporins and vespid chemotactic peptides 
      isolated from Vespa magnifica. Amolopin can stimulate insulin release in INS-1 cells 
      in a dose-dependent manner. Primary investigation on its action mechanisms reveals 
      that amolopin does not increase the influx of Ca(2+). In conclusion, a novel 
      16-amino acid peptide with insulin-releasing activity is initially discovered from 
      the skin secretion of A. loloensis frog. Further work is necessary to evaluate its 
      potential as novel anti-diabetic candidate.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major pathogenic factor in endotoxin shock or sepsis. 
      Most antibiotics have little clinical anti-endotoxin activity, but some 
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to be effective in blocking LPS. We 
      identified a novel peptide from the skin secretions of Bombina maxima (B. _maxima) 
      by challenging the skin of frogs with an LPS solution. Peptide 2 has an amino acid 
      sequence of LVGKLLKGAVGDVCGLLPIC. Peptide 2 possesses low hemolytic activity, low 
      cytotoxicity against RAW 264.7 cells, and strong anti-inflammatory activity. 
      Moreover, peptide 2 plays an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting inflammatory 
      cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). A 
      biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay indicated that peptide 2 binds to LPS with 
      strong affinity and that this interaction has an affinity constant (K(D)) value of 
      1.05 × 10(-9) M. A survival study showed that peptide 2 possesses potent 
      LPS-neutralizing activity to protect LPS-treated mice from death. In conclusion, we 
      have identified a potent peptide with LPS neutralizing activity, which lays a 
      foundation for future research and development.

TI  - Efficacy of frog skin lipids in wound healing.
PG  - 74
LID - 10.1186/1476-511X-9-74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frog skin has been sequentially and scientifically evaluated by our 
      group for its wound healing efficiency. Owing to the complex structure of skin, 
      attempts were being made to analyse the role of individual constituents in different 
      phases of healing. Our earlier papers have shown the significance of frog skin not 
      only in wound healing but also enhancing the proliferating activity of the epidermal 
      and dermal cells which are instrumental for normal healing process. We also have 
      identified for the first time novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Rana 
      tigerina and thereby reduce the complications involved in the sepsis. PURPOSE OF THE 
      STUDY AND RESULTS: The current study envisages the role of frog skin lipids in the 
      inflammatory phase of wound healing. The lipid moiety of the frog skin dominated by 
      phospholipids exhibited a dose dependent acceleration of healing irrespective of the 
      mode of application. The efficiency of the extract is attributed partially to the 
      anti-inflammatory activity as observed by the histochemical and immunostimulatory 
      together with plethysmographic studies. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, frog skin for the first 
      time has been demonstrated to possess lipid components with pharmaceutical and 
      therapeutic potential. The identification and characterization of such natural 
      healing molecules and evaluating their mechanism of action would therefore provide 
      basis for understanding the cues of Nature and hence can be used for application in 
      medicine.

TI  - Antimicrobial action of histone H2B in Escherichia coli: evidence for membrane 
      translocation and DNA-binding of a histone H2B fragment after proteolytic cleavage 
      by outer membrane proteinase T.
PG  - 1693-702
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.07.003 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have led to the isolation of histone H2B with antibacterial 
      properties from an extract of the skin of the Schlegel's green tree frog Rhacophorus 
      schlegelii and it is now demonstrated that the intact peptide is released into 
      norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions. In order to investigate the mechanism of 
      action of this peptide, a maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused histone H2B (MBP-H2B) 
      conjugate was prepared and subjected to antimicrobial assay. The fusion protein 
      showed bacteriostatic activity against Escherichia coli strain JCM5491 with a 
      minimum inhibitory concentration of 11 microM. The lysate prepared from JCM5491 
      cells was capable of fragmenting MBP-H2B within the histone H2B region, but the 
      lysate from the outer membrane proteinase T (OmpT) gene-deleted BL21(DE3) cells was 
      not. FITC-labeled MBP-H2B (FITC-MBP-H2B) penetrated into the bacterial cell membrane 
      of JCM5491 and ompT-transformed BL21(DE3) cells, but not into ompT-deleted BL21(DE3) 
      cells. Gel retardation assay using MBP-H2B-deletion mutants indicated that MBP-H2B 
      bound to DNA at a site within the N-terminal region of histone H2B. Consequently, it 
      is proposed that the antimicrobial action of histone H2B involves, at least in part, 
      penetration of an OmpT-produced N-terminal histone H2B fragment into the bacterial 
      cell membrane with subsequent inhibition of cell functions.

TI  - Bradykinin-related peptides and tryptophyllins in the skin secretions of the most 
      primitive extant frog, Ascaphus truei.
PG  - 193-9
AB  - The tailed frog Ascaphus truei occupies a unique position in phylogeny as the most 
      primitive extant anuran and is regarded as the sister taxon to the clade of all 
      other living frogs. A previous study led to the isolation of eight antimicrobial 
      peptides, termed ascaphins, from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions. 
      Peptidomic analysis (HPLC separation followed by MALDI mass spectrometry and Edman 
      degradation) of these secretions has led to the identification and structural 
      characterization of 13 additional peptides present in relatively high concentration. 
      In addition to bradykinin (BK; RPPGFSPFR), a C-terminally extended bradykinin 
      (peptide RD-11; RPPGFSPFRVD), a bradykinin-like peptide (peptide AR-10; APVPGLSPFR), 
      and a C-terminally extended form of this peptide (peptide AV-12; APVPGLSPFRVV) were 
      obtained in pure form. These peptides produced concentration-dependent relaxation of 
      precontracted mouse tracheal rings with a rank order of potency of 
      BK>RD-11>AR-10>AV-12 but only RD-11 caused the same maximal relaxation as 
      bradykinin. Four small peptides were also isolated from the skin secretions that 
      contain the Pro-Trp motif that is a characteristic of the tryptophyllin family of 
      peptides previously identified in skins of frogs of the family Hylidae. The data 
      show that the synthesis of dermal peptides that may play a role in defense against 
      predators arose early in the evolution of anurans.

AB  - Amphibians possess innate immune defences, including antimicrobial peptides and 
      symbiotic bacterial communities, that can protect them from infectious diseases, 
      including chytridiomycosis. On-going research is attempting to use amphibian 
      symbiotic bacteria to develop probiotic treatments that can protect hosts from the 
      causative agent of chytridiomycosis, the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis. Events that cause disruption of symbiotic bacterial communities or 
      deplete peptide stores could increase the susceptibility of individuals to disease 
      and may have implications for amphibians involved in probiotic trials or time course 
      studies that investigate symbiotic bacterial communities. It has previously been 
      shown that passive integrated transponder tagging of frogs causes a rapid (within 
      24 h) and major proliferation of micro-organisms on the skin. Here, we show that 
      marking of red-eyed tree frogs (Agalychnis callidryas) with visible elastomer has no 
      effect on adrenal response (represented by faecal glucocorticoid metabolite 
      concentrations) or peptide production, although there was evidence of a slightly 
      greater microbial abundance associated with the skin of marked frogs 2 weeks after 
      tagging. The results indicate that visible elastomer may be a preferable marking 
      technique to passive integrated transponder tagging, particularly in the context of 
      probiotic trials or time course studies that investigate symbiotic bacterial 
      communities. More work is required to determine the effects of different marking 
      techniques on physiological responses of amphibians, whether these physiological 
      responses are consistent across host species and whether such 'non-invasive' marking 
      methods affect the susceptibility of amphibians to infectious pathogens, such as 
      B. dendrobatidis.

AB  - Fungal infections in humans, wildlife, and plants are a growing concern because of 
      their devastating effects on human and ecosystem health. In recent years, 
      populations of many amphibian species have declined, and some have become extinct 
      due to chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis. For some endangered amphibian species, captive colonies are the best 
      intermediate solution towards eventual reintroduction, and effective antifungal 
      treatments are needed to cure chytridiomycosis and limit the spread of this pathogen 
      in such survival assurance colonies. Currently, the best accepted treatment for 
      infected amphibians is itraconazole, but its toxic side effects reduce its 
      usefulness for many species. Safer antifungal treatments are needed for disease 
      control. Here, we show that nikkomycin Z, a chitin synthase inhibitor, dramatically 
      alters the cell wall stability of B. dendrobatidis cells and completely inhibits 
      growth of B. dendrobatidis at 250 μM. Low doses of nikkomycin Z enhanced the 
      effectiveness of natural antimicrobial skin peptide mixtures tested in vitro. These 
      studies suggest that nikkomycin Z would be an effective treatment to significantly 
      reduce the fungal burden in frogs infected by B. dendrobatidis.

TI  - Innate immunity and the normal microflora.
PG  - 5-16
AB  - This paper discusses the following ten subtitles with the contents indicated. 1. To 
      meet a microbe: discusses the four alternatives in host-microbe interactions. 2. 
      Receptors and signal transduction giving gene activation: discusses the 
      lipopolysaccharide receptor and the limitations of cell cultures versus use of live 
      animals. 3. Effector molecules--antimicrobial peptides with and without cysteines. A 
      data base exists with over 500 sequences. This paper gives a general overview of 
      five classes of gene-encoded effector molecules, based on the absence or presence of 
      cysteines. These molecules are peptide antibiotics with wide spectra against 
      different microbes. They are synthesized as propeptides and post-translational 
      modifications are common. 4. Effectors of innate immunity--lethal action without 
      host damage: evaluates current opinions about the mode of action of peptide 
      antibiotics and the fact that these effectors do not create host damage. 5. Genes, 
      introns and movable elements. Two cecropin genes containing movable elements and the 
      human cathelicidin gene for proFALL-39/hCAP18 are discussed. 6. The natural 
      microflora. Hippos or frogs as model systems. This section includes the isolation of 
      bacteria from the normal flora of frogs; Aeromonas hydrophila, the bacterium found 
      on all five frog species studied; arguments and selected examples of frog-microbe 
      interactions in vivo and in vitro; and the use of glucocorticoids as control for 
      nuclear factor-kappa B/I kappa B alpha regulation of effector genes. 7. The use of 
      germ-free mice--hard facts from hard work: summarizes new findings which indicate 
      that germ-free mice are born with a set of antibacterial peptides in their small 
      intestine. The intestine of germ-free mice monoinfected with A. hydrophila have 
      peptide patterns that differ depending on a pretreatment with cortisone. 8. Looking 
      back--an evolutionary perspective on innate immunity: arguments for an early 
      evolutionary need for gene-encoded antibacterial factors. Caenorhabditis elegans 
      should provide some answers. The finding of cecropin-like peptides in Helicobacter 
      pylori and the indications that cecropins are derived from ribosomal protein L1. 9. 
      What about viruses? Arguments for the lack of innate immunity against viruses. 10. 
      Five questions floating in the pond of immunology. The normal microflora, its size 
      and control are too often left out from immunological thinking. Animal model systems 
      may sometimes invite misinterpretation. Which animal species are more equal than 
      others?

TI  - From frog integument to human skin: dermatological perspectives from frog skin 
      biology.
PG  - 618-55
LID - 10.1111/brv.12072 [doi]
AB  - For over a century, frogs have been studied across various scientific fields, 
      including physiology, embryology, neuroscience, (neuro)endocrinology, ecology, 
      genetics, behavioural science, evolution, drug development, and conservation 
      biology. In some cases, frog skin has proven very successful as a research model, 
      for example aiding in the study of ion transport through tight epithelia, where it 
      has served as a model for the vertebrate distal renal tubule and mammalian 
      epithelia. However, it has rarely been considered in comparative studies involving 
      human skin. Yet, despite certain notable adaptations that have enabled frogs to 
      survive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, frog skin has many features in 
      common with human skin. Here we present a comprehensive overview of frog (and toad) 
      skin ontogeny, anatomy, cytology, neuroendocrinology and immunology, with special 
      attention to its unique adaptations as well as to its similarities with the 
      mammalian integument, including human skin. We hope to provide a valuable reference 
      point and a source of inspiration for both amphibian investigators and mammalian 
      researchers studying the structural and functional properties of the largest organ 
      of the vertebrate body.

TI  - Quantity - but not diversity - of secreted peptides and proteins increases with age 
      in the tree frog Pithecopus nordestinus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amphibians inhabit the terrestrial environment, a conquest achieved 
      after several evolutionary steps, which were still insufficient to make them 
      completely independent of the aquatic environment. These processes gave rise to many 
      morphological and physiological changes, making their skin (and cutaneous secretion) 
      rich in bioactive molecules. Among the tree frogs, the secretion is composed mainly 
      of peptides; but alkaloids, proteins and steroids can also be found depending on the 
      species. The most known class of biologically active molecules is the antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) that act against bacteria, fungi and protozoans. Although these 
      molecules are well-studied among the hylids, AMPs ontogeny remains unknown. 
      Therefore, we performed peptidomic and proteomic analyses of Pithecopus nordestinus 
      (formerly Phyllomedusa nordestina) in order to evaluate the peptide content in 
      post-metamorphosed juveniles and adult individuals. METHODS: Cutaneous secretion of 
      both life stages of individuals was obtained and analyzed by LC-MS/MS after 
      reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds or reduction, alkylation and hydrolysis 
      by trypsin. RESULTS: Differences in the TIC profile of juveniles and adults in both 
      treatments were observed. Moreover, the proteomic data revealed known proteins and 
      peptides, with slight differences in the composition, according to the life stage 
      and the treatment. AMPs were identified, and bradykinin-potentiating peptides were 
      observed in trypsin-treated samples, which suggests a protein source of such peptide 
      (cryptide). CONCLUSION: In general, skin secretion contents were similar between 
      juveniles and adults, varying in quantity, indicating that the different stages of 
      life are reflected in the number of molecules and not on their diversity.

TI  - A computational approach for peptidomic analysis in taxonomic study of amphibian 
      species.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - Peptides in the skin secretion of frogs have been studied for some time now because 
      they frequently possess important biological activity such as antibiotic, 
      antimicrobial, or anticancer properties. In this paper, we present a computational 
      approach for measuring the degree of similarity between the entire peptide 
      complement of the skin secretion of specimens from the same or different species. 
      The first step in the analysis is the generation of a mass spectral profile from an 
      experimental high-performance liquid chromatography/electrosparay ionization 
      analysis of the sample. An "overlap" between the mass spectral profiles of different 
      specimens is then proposed as a measure of their similarity. Analysis of specimens 
      from three species of the genus Litoria, viz., L. Aurea, L. Caerulea, and L. 
      Infrafrenata, and Rana Capito of genus Rana shows that the degree of similarity is 
      highest between specimens from the same species, lower for specimens from different 
      species of the same genus, and lowest between specimens from different genera. This 
      indicates that comparison of skin peptide profiles (i.e., mass spectral profiles of 
      skin secretion) is potentially a useful aid in the taxonomic study of amphibian 
      species.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases caused by fungal taxa are increasing and are placing a 
      substantial burden on economies and ecosystems worldwide. Of the emerging fungal 
      diseases, chytridomycosis caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis 
      (hereafter Bd) is linked to global amphibian declines. Amphibians have innate 
      immunity, as well as additional resistance through cutaneous microbial communities. 
      Despite the targeting of bacteria as potential probiotics, the role of fungi in the 
      protection against Bd infection in unknown. We used a four-part approach, including 
      high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal communities, cultivation of 
      fungi, Bd challenge assays, and experimental additions of probiotic to Midwife Toads 
      (Altyes obstetricans), to examine the overlapping roles of bacterial and fungal 
      microbiota in pathogen defense in captive bred poison arrow frogs (Dendrobates sp.). 
      Our results revealed that cutaneous fungal taxa differed from environmental 
      microbiota across three species and a subspecies of Dendrobates spp. frogs. 
      Cultivation of host-associated and environmental fungi realved numerous taxa with 
      the ability to inhibit or facilitate the growth of Bd. The abundance of cutaneous 
      fungi contributed more to Bd defense (~45% of the fungal community), than did 
      bacteria (~10%) and frog species harbored distinct inhibitory communities that were 
      distinct from the environment. Further, we demonstrated that a fungal probiotic 
      therapy did not induce an endocrine-immune reaction, in contrast to bacterial 
      probiotics that stressed amphibian hosts and suppressed antimicrobial peptide 
      responses, limiting their long-term colonization potential. Our results suggest that 
      probiotic strategies against amphibian fungal pathogens should, in addition to 
      bacterial probiotics, focus on host-associated and environmental fungi such as 
      Penicillium and members of the families Chaetomiaceae and Lasiosphaeriaceae.

TI  - Gene expression differs in susceptible and resistant amphibians exposed to

LID - 170910
AB  - Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium 
      dendrobatidis (Bd), has devastated global amphibian biodiversity. Nevertheless, some 
      hosts avoid disease after Bd exposure even as others experience near-complete 
      extirpation. It remains unclear whether the amphibian adaptive immune system plays a 
      role in Bd defence. Here, we describe gene expression in two host species-one 
      susceptible to chytridiomycosis and one resistant-following exposure to two Bd 
      isolates that differ in virulence. Susceptible wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) had high 
      infection loads and mortality when exposed to the more virulent Bd isolate but lower 
      infection loads and no fatal disease when exposed to the less virulent isolate. 
      Resistant American bullfrogs (R. catesbeiana) had high survival across treatments 
      and rapidly cleared Bd infection or avoided infection entirely. We found widespread 
      upregulation of adaptive immune genes and downregulation of important metabolic and 
      cellular maintenance components in wood frogs after Bd exposure, whereas American 
      bullfrogs showed little gene expression change and no evidence of an adaptive immune 
      response. Wood frog responses suggest that adaptive immune defences may be 
      ineffective against virulent Bd isolates that can cause rapid physiological 
      dysfunction. By contrast, American bullfrogs exhibited robust resistance to Bd that 
      is likely attributable, at least in part, to their continued upkeep of metabolic and 
      skin integrity pathways as well as greater antimicrobial peptide expression compared 
      to wood frogs, regardless of exposure. Greater understanding of these defences will 
      ultimately help conservationists manage chytridiomycosis.

PG  - 191-200

AB  - The emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis has been implicated in declines and 
      disappearances of amphibian populations around the world. However, susceptibility to 
      infection and the extent of pathological effects of infection vary among hosts, and 
      species with life histories that include parental care of direct-developing 
      terrestrial eggs may tend to be less susceptible. We examined samples from a total 
      of 595 individuals of 9 species of direct-developing Australian frogs in the family 
      Microhylidae for the presence of infection by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). 
      Between 1995 and 2004, 336 samples were collected; 102 of these were analysed 
      histologically and 234 were tissues stored in alcohol, which were examined using 
      diagnostic quantitative PCR (qPCR). Swab samples were collected from 259 frogs from 
      2005 to 2008 and were examined using qPCR. None of the 595 samples showed evidence 
      of infection by Bd. If these data are regarded as a single sample representative of 
      Australian microhylids, the upper 95% binomial confidence limit for the prevalence 
      of infection in frogs of this family is 0.0062 (<1%). Even if only the data from the 
      more powerful diagnostic qPCR tests are used, the upper 95% confidence limit for 
      prevalence is 0.0075 (<1%). Our data suggest that Australian microhylids have a very 
      low prevalence of infection by Bd in nature, and thus are either not susceptible, or 
      are only slightly susceptible, to chytridiomycosis. This could be due solely to, or 
      in combination with, low rates of transmission and to factors that promote 
      resistance to infection, including ecological or behavioural characteristics, innate 
      immune functions such as antimicrobial skin peptides, or antimicrobial symbionts in 
      skin flora.

AB  - Bacterial pore-forming toxin aerolysin-like proteins (ALPs) are widely distributed 
      in animals and plants. However, functional studies on these ALPs remain in their 
      infancy. βγ-CAT is the first example of a secreted pore-forming protein that 
      functions to modulate the endolysosome pathway via endocytosis and pore formation on 
      endolysosomes. However, the specific cell surface molecules mediating the action of 
      βγ-CAT remain elusive. Here, the actions of βγ-CAT were largely attenuated by either 
      addition or elimination of acidic glycosphingolipids (AGSLs). Further study revealed 
      that the ALP and trefoil factor (TFF) subunits of βγ-CAT bind to gangliosides and 
      sulfatides, respectively. Additionally, disruption of lipid rafts largely impaired 
      the actions of βγ-CAT. Finally, the ability of βγ-CAT to clear pathogens was 
      attenuated in AGSL-eliminated frogs. These findings revealed a previously unknown 
      double binding pattern of an animal-secreted ALP in complex with TFF that initiates 
      ALP-induced endolysosomal pathway regulation, ultimately leading to effective 
      antimicrobial responses.

AB  - Skin secretions of frogs have a high chemical complexity. They have diverse types of 
      biomolecules, such as proteins, peptides, biogenic amines, and alkaloids. These 
      compounds protect amphibians' skin against growth of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa 
      and participate in defense system against attack from predators. Therewith, this 
      work performed biochemical and biological profile of macroglands parotoid secretion 
      from cane toad. For poison analysis, we performed molecular exclusion and reverse 
      phase chromatography, electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial, 
      antiplasmodial, leishmanicidal, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory 
      activity of crude and/or fractions of R. marina secretion were also evaluated. 
      Fractionation prior to filtration from poison showed separation of low mass content 
      (steroids and alkaloids) and high molecular mass (protein). Material below 10 kDa 
      two steroids, marinobufagin and desacetylcinobufagin, was detected. Crude extract 
      and fractions were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      Escherichia coli, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania guyanensis, and Leishmania 
      braziliensis. Crude extract was also active against cancer cells although it was not 
      cytotoxic for normal cells. This extract did not show significant DNA damage but it 
      showed an important inflammatory effect in vivo. The information obtained in this 
      work contributes to the understanding of the constituents of R. marina secretion as 
      well as the bioactive potential of these molecules.
